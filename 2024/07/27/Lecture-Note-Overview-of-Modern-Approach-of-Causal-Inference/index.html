    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is one of my notes of the online Causal Inference Course in
Columbia University, taught by Michael E. Sobel who is a professor in
the Department of Statistics. It would be good to have this overview of
causal inference regarding the framework in mind before getting into
statistical and theoretical details, especially for beginners. A clear
approach framework is very important that it’s not only because rigorous
experiment and analysis methods could be developed with this
well-defined framework, but also because it can guide you to deal with
challenging situations in a correct way, while being clear about the
limitations and assumptions at the same time. This is why it became a
Science.</p>
<h2 id="modern-approach-for-causal-inference">Modern Approach for Causal
Inference</h2>
<p>The modern dominant approach for causal inference, significantly
influenced by Donald Rubin’s contributions, primarily revolves around
the following key ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Potential Outcomes Framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Potential Outcomes Notation</strong>: Introduced by Neyman
and further developed by Rubin, this framework involves conceptualizing
the outcomes that would occur both with and without the treatment for
each unit. Each unit has a potential outcome under treatment and a
potential outcome under control, but only one of these outcomes is
observed for each unit.</li>
<li><strong>Average Treatment Effects</strong>: The focus is on
estimating the average causal effect of a treatment across a population.
This involves comparing the average outcomes of treated and untreated
groups, taking into account the potential outcomes framework.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Randomization and Its Analogs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role of Randomization</strong>: In experimental studies,
random assignment of treatments is crucial for ensuring that the
treatment groups are comparable, allowing for unbiased estimation of
causal effects.</li>
<li><strong>Randomization-like Conditions in Observational
Studies</strong>: Rubin extended the framework to observational studies
by arguing that causal inferences can be made if these studies fulfill
conditions similar to randomization. This involves controlling for
confounding variables that influence both the treatment and the outcome,
often through methods like matching, regression adjustment, or
instrumental variables.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Counterfactual Reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Counterfactual Conditionals</strong>: Causal relationships
must satisfy counterfactual conditions. This means that for a cause to
be deemed responsible for an effect, it should be demonstrable that if
the cause had not occurred, the effect would not have occurred. This is
formalized through the potential outcomes framework.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="key-features-of-rubins-approach">Key Features of Rubin’s
Approach:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application to Both Experimental and Observational
Studies</strong>: Rubin’s framework is versatile and can be applied to
both types of studies, providing a unified approach to causal
inference.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Estimating Causal Effects</strong>: The primary
goal is to estimate the causal effect of treatments or interventions,
rather than simply identifying associations.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Statistical Methods</strong>: The approach leverages
statistical methods to control for confounding variables and to estimate
causal effects, emphasizing the importance of rigorous statistical
analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-key-criteria-of-modern-causal-inference">Two Key Criteria of
Modern Causal Inference</h3>
<p>The modern dominant approach to causal inference primarily builds on
two key criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Causation at the Singular Level:</p>
<ul>
<li>This criterion allows for the possibility that causation can be
specific to individual subjects or units, acknowledging effect
heterogeneity. It means that a cause may produce an effect in one
individual but not necessarily in another, depending on various
conditions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Satisfaction of Counterfactual Conditionals:</p>
<ul>
<li>A causal relationship must sustain a counterfactual conditional.
This means that for a cause to be deemed responsible for an effect, it
should be demonstrable that if the cause had not occurred, the effect
would not have occurred. This criterion is essential for defining and
reasoning about causal relationships in both experimental and
observational studies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="impact-on-empirical-research">Impact on Empirical Research:</h3>
<p>Rubin’s contributions have led to more careful and precise inferences
about causal effects in various disciplines, particularly in the social
sciences. Researchers now more rigorously design studies and analyze
data to ensure that their conclusions about causality are well-founded
within this robust statistical framework.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-in-randomized-studies">Challenges in Randomized
Studies:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Non-compliance with Treatment Assignments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: In a study by the University of Michigan
in the 1990s, unemployed persons were assigned to receive or not receive
assistance in job searching. A significant percentage of those assigned
to the treatment group did not actually take the treatment, complicating
the comparison between groups and potentially overestimating the
treatment’s effectiveness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Intermediate Variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: An educational researcher wants to know
the effect of encouragement to study on test scores. While the
researcher can estimate the effect of encouragement, estimating the
direct effect of study time is more complicated because it involves
intermediate variables (encouragement affecting study time, which in
turn affects test scores).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Breakdown of Random Assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If a subject’s treatment adherence is
influenced by their perception of treatment benefits, comparing only
those who comply can lead to biased estimates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="challenges-in-observational-studies">Challenges in Observational
Studies:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Identifying and Measuring All Covariates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: When studying the effect of education on
earnings, researchers must account for various covariates that affect
both education levels and earnings. Failure to identify or measure all
relevant covariates can lead to biased estimates.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Estimating Average Treatment Effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: In observational studies, various methods
like matching, weighting, and regression are used to estimate treatment
effects. Each method has its own set of practical issues and assumptions
that need to be carefully managed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Longitudinal Observational Studies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: When treatments administered in different
periods depend on previous treatments and outcomes, analysis becomes
more complicated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interference:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: In a housing experiment conducted by the
U.S. government, participants assigned to move from housing projects to
suburbs knew each other. If the treatment assignment of one participant
influenced the decision or outcome of another, traditional analysis
methods might not be adequate.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These examples illustrate that both randomized and observational
studies require careful consideration of various factors to ensure
accurate and reliable causal inferences.</p>
<h2 id="potential-outcomes-unit-and-average-effect">Potential Outcomes,
Unit, and Average Effect</h2>
<h3 id="potential-outcomes-framework">Potential Outcomes Framework</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Potential Outcomes:
<ul>
<li>Each unit (e.g., individual) has two potential outcomes: one if
treated and one if not treated. However, only one outcome can be
observed for each unit.</li>
<li>This leads to the “fundamental problem of causal inference,” where
we cannot observe both potential outcomes for a single unit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Notation and Unit Effects:
<ul>
<li>For a unit <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, denote the
outcome as <span class="math inline">\(Y\_i (1)\)</span> if treated and
<span class="math inline">\(Y\_i (0)\)</span> if not treated.</li>
<li>The unit effect is defined as the difference <span
class="math inline">\(Y\_i (1)−Y\_i (0)\)</span>.</li>
<li>The observed outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> is
determined by the treatment assignment <span
class="math inline">\(Z\_i\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(Z\_i=1\)</span> if the unit is treated and <span
class="math inline">\(Z\_i=0\)</span> if not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Randomized vs. Observational Studies:
<ul>
<li>In randomized experiments, treatment assignment <span
class="math inline">\(Z\_i\)</span> is random.</li>
<li>In observational studies, subjects choose their treatment,
introducing potential biases.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="average-treatment-effects">Average Treatment Effects</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE):
<ul>
<li>The average of the unit effects for the sample.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Finite Population Average Treatment Effect (FATE):
<ul>
<li>The average treatment effect for a finite population from which the
sample is drawn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Average Treatment Effect (ATE):
<ul>
<li>The average treatment effect in an infinite or large population.
This is treated as an expectation of the potential outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Estimands of Interest:
<ul>
<li>Various estimands depend on the marginal distributions of potential
outcomes, such as ATE and Average Treatment Effect on the Treated
(ATT).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Challenges and Assumptions:
<ul>
<li>Estimating these effects requires assumptions like the Stable Unit
Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), which ensures that the potential
outcomes are well-defined and not affected by other units’
treatments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="practical-implications">Practical Implications</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Decision-Making:
<ul>
<li>Knowledge of average treatment effects aids decision-making in
contexts like medical treatments and policy implementations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ignorability Conditions:
<ul>
<li>Under certain conditions, known as ignorability or unconfoundedness,
it is possible to use observed data to estimate causal effects
reliably.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extensions and Assumptions:
<ul>
<li>The framework extends to multiple treatments and continuous
treatments, though additional assumptions may be required.</li>
<li>SUTVA assumes no alternative representations of treatment and no
interference between units, which may need adjustments in certain
studies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2
id="conditions-allow-average-effects-be-unbiasedly-consistently-estimated">Conditions
Allow Average Effects be Unbiasedly/ Consistently Estimated</h2>
<h3 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Average Treatment Effect (ATE) Estimation:
<ul>
<li><strong>Random Sampling</strong>: Drawing random samples of treated
(<span class="math inline">\(y\_1\)</span>) and untreated (<span
class="math inline">\(y\_0\)</span>) units to estimate their respective
means.</li>
<li><strong>Sample Means</strong>: The means of treated (<span
class="math inline">\(\\bar{y}\_1\)</span>) and untreated (<span
class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\_0\)</span>) samples serve as unbiased and
consistent estimators of the population means.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unconfoundedness:
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Treatment assignment <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is independent of potential outcomes
(<span class="math inline">\(y\_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\_1\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Intuition</strong>: In randomized experiments, treatment
assignment is blind to potential outcomes, ensuring unconfoundedness. In
observational studies, treatment assignment might depend on factors
related to potential outcomes, potentially confounding the
estimates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Randomized Experiment vs. Observational Study:
<ul>
<li><strong>Randomized Experiment</strong>: Treatment assignment is
random (e.g., coin flip), ensuring <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is independent of <span
class="math inline">\(y\_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\_1\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Observational Study</strong>: Treatment assignment may
depend on patient characteristics, potentially leading to biased
estimates.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Age and Treatment Example:
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong>: Older patients might forego treatment
believing it’s less beneficial, while younger patients might opt for
treatment believing it’s more beneficial.</li>
<li><strong>Consequence</strong>: Naive comparison between treated and
untreated groups might overestimate the treatment effect due to
confounding by age.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ignorability-condition">Ignorability Condition</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Condition: <span class="math inline">\(y\_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\_1\)</span> are independent of <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> given covariates <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (e.g., age).
<ul>
<li><strong>Stratified Analysis</strong>: In both randomized experiments
and observational studies, stratifying on covariates like age can help
achieve conditional unconfoundedness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adjusting for Covariates:
<ul>
<li><strong>Randomized Experiment</strong>: Can stratify on covariates
either before or after the experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Observational Study</strong>: Treat it as a stratified
randomized experiment by conditioning on covariates related to treatment
status and potential outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="practical-implications-1">Practical Implications</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Comparison of Groups:
<ul>
<li>In a stratified randomized experiment, compare treated and control
groups within each stratum (e.g., age group) to estimate ATE.</li>
<li>In observational studies, stratify on covariates to reduce bias and
estimate ATE as if it were a stratified randomized experiment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Challenges in Observational Studies:
<ul>
<li><strong>Unknown Assignment Mechanism</strong>: Unlike randomized
experiments, the assignment mechanism in observational studies is not
controlled, making it harder to ensure unconfoundedness.</li>
<li><strong>Measurement of Confounders</strong>: It’s crucial to measure
and account for all relevant confounders, though it may not always be
possible.</li>
</ul></li>
