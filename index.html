<p>Shaping the opinions of others, or building influence, is about more
than just data and logic. It's about understanding and managing

<p>Handling your own emotions: Notice and reflect on what is driving
your actions, such as fear, and then name it. This helps you move
forward with clarity and confidence.</p>
<p>Leading others through their emotions: When you want to get buy-in
for your ideas, help people process their emotions. You can do this by
creating a space that welcomes emotions, validating their concerns, and
then shifting their focus to what they can do to move forward.</p>

<p>The near-finalized framework of a deal between the U.S. and China
concerning the popular social media application TikTok, involves
creating a new U.S. entity to manage the app’s American operations, with
an investor consortium, including Oracle, taking a roughly 80%
controlling stake, which satisfies a recent U.S. law regarding foreign
ownership. A key component of the agreement is the establishment of
American control over user data and the crucial content-recommendation
algorithms, although they will be based on technology licensed from
TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Furthermore, the article
notes that President Trump has delayed the TikTok ban until December as
negotiations conclude, signaling the resolution of a multi-year national
security dispute over the app's influence in the U.S. Both Chinese and
American officials have reached a basic consensus on the terms, which
also include Oracle managing U.S. user data at its facilities in
Texas.</p>

<p>Dojo was a custom-built supercomputer intended to be the cornerstone
of Tesla's AI ambitions, specifically for training the neural networks
of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and humanoid robots.</p>
<p>The primary strategic reasons cited for the project's termination
include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the strategic pivot to AI6 chips. The AI6 chip is Tesla’s new
strategic bet on a chip design intended to scale across FSD, Tesla’s
Optimus humanoid robots, and high-performance AI training in data
centers</li>
<li>moving away from hardware self-reliance. Dojo was intended to reduce
reliance on expensive eand difficulty-to-secure Nvidia GPUs, but Tesla
is now "going all-in on partnerships" with major chip providers,
including Nvidia, AMD, and Samsung (which will build the AI6 chip)</li>
<li>technological and compatibility hurdles. Dojo’s design, based on
proprietary D1 chips, faced inherent technological challenges related to
integration with the broader AI ecosystem</li>
<li>internal competition and redundency. In August 2024, Tesla began
promoting Cortex, described as the company’s "giant new AI training
supercluster" being built at Tesla HQ in Austin. Cortex was later
deployed at Gigafactory Texas.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>While existing machine learning (ML) models optimize for high
engagement, they can result in repetitive and potentially "spammy"
notifications, leading users to disable them. To combat this, the new
framework applies a multiplicative penalty to notification scores based
on their similarity to recently sent ones, using criteria such as author
and product type. This strategy has successfully reduced notification
volume while increasing engagement rates by ensuring a more varied and
personalized mix of content.</p>
<p>The methodology begins with the existing machine learning (ML)
models, which calculate a base score for notification candidates based
on factors like the probability of a user clicking (Click-Through-Rate
or CTR) and time spent. The new framework introduces a diversity layer
on top of these existing engagement ML models.</p>
<p>The methodology involves the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Evaluation of Similarity:</strong> The diversity layer
evaluates each notification candidate's similarity to recently sent
notifications across multiple dimensions, such as content, author,
notification type, and product surface.</li>
<li><strong>Application of Penalties:</strong> The system applies
carefully calibrated penalties, expressed as multiplicative demotion
factors, to downrank candidates that are too similar or repetitive to
recent notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Re-ranking:</strong> The adjusted scores (base relevance
score multiplied by the demotion factor) are used to re-rank the
candidates.</li>
<li><strong>Selection:</strong> The final selection process uses a
quality bar to choose the top-ranked candidate that successfully passes
both the ranking and diversity criteria.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within the diversity layer, the methodology is mathematically
implemented using a multiplicative demotion factor applied to the base
relevance score:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Final Score } (S(c)) = \text{Base
Ranking Score } (R(c)) \cdot \text{Diversity Demotion Multiplier }
(D(c))\]</span></p>
<p>Key aspects of this calculation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demotion Multiplier (<span
class="math inline">\(D(c)\)</span>):</strong> This is a penalty factor
where the value falls within the range of 0 to 1 (<span
class="math inline">\(D(c) \in\)</span>), reducing the score based on
similarity to recently sent notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Similarity Signal:</strong> To calculate <span
class="math inline">\(D(c)\)</span>, a similarity signal (<span
class="math inline">\(p_i(c)\)</span>) is computed for a set of semantic
dimensions (e.g., author, product type) using a maximal marginal
relevance (MMR) approach.</li>
<li><strong>Binary Baseline:</strong> In the baseline implementation,
the similarity signal <span class="math inline">\(p_i(c)\)</span> is
binary: it equals 1 if the similarity exceeds a predefined threshold
(<span class="math inline">\(\tau_i\)</span>), and 0 otherwise.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The best roadmaps aren't checklists; they tell a story about why
something is being built. They show how short-term initiatives connect
to long-term strategic goals.</p>
<p>The <strong>Now, Next, Later Framework</strong> is a core pattern,
reflecting the reality of uncertainty. Now initiatives are tight,
concrete, and focused on current goals (e.g., MVP launch). Next
initiatives are more exploratory bets. Later initiatives are
deliberately fuzzy, long-term aspirations that signal intent without
making firm promises.</p>
<p>Effective roadmaps frame initiatives as problems to solve and tie
them to clear outcomes and business objectives (e.g., "reduce onboarding
friction" instead of "ship a new login flow"). This keeps the team
flexible and focused on results.</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all roadmap. A startup's roadmap is about
survival and proving a hypothesis. A scale-up's roadmap is about
smoothing friction and deepening engagement. A hardware roadmap must
account for manufacturing cycles, while a mission-critical one must
prioritize compliance and security.</p>

<p>A point made around 'reskilling': While GenAI can immediately boost a

in a traditional sense. The study found that participants were able to

not retain the knowledge or skills gained after the tools were taken
away. The article refers to GenAI as an "exoskeleton" that enables
workers to do more, but does not intrinsically change what they have

</blockquote>
<p>Seven Non-Obvious Strategies</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Never rely only on online submission: Avoid the "digital dustbin" by
finding an alternative path in, such as a referral, connection, or
direct reach-out.</li>
<li>Ask for advice, not a job: Sincerely seek guidance on entering a
field or company, as people are often generous and may uncover new
opportunities for you.</li>
<li>Give them a reason to say yes: Counter the process of finding
reasons to say <em>no</em> (misspellings, poor grammar) by providing
human connection points like shared alma maters, hobbies, or passions to
hack affinity bias.</li>
<li>Find the “you-shaped hole”: Seek roles where your unique skills,
experience, or passion make you the best bet, demonstrating you can "hit
the ground running on day one".</li>
<li>See the world through the hiring manager’s eyes: Hiring managers
prioritize managing risk because a bad hire is costly. Your job is to
close the asymmetry of information, prove you are a "sure bet," and show
you are a great return on investment.</li>
<li>Do the job before you get the job: Demonstrate initiative by acting
like an employee; use the product, talk to customers, and bring specific
ideas or prototypes to show you want <em>this</em> job.</li>
<li>Tailor your resume (and your story) for the role: Treat your resume
as a "living document" to tell a specific story, reframing factual
experiences to align with the target role and "speak the language of the
hiring company".</li>

          <p>I read the book "<em>Never Split the Difference : Negotiating As If
Your Life Depended On It</em>" by Chris Voss a month ago and finally got
time to write some notes down. I love this type of book that provides
structured, practical suggestions for achieving a goal, backed by
academic research and theories.</p>
<figure>
<img
src="/di-blog/2025/09/20/Never-Split-the-Difference/never_split_the_difference.JPG"
alt="never_split_the_difference" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">never_split_the_difference</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This book is building its argument on some well-established,
peer-reviewed psychological theories that show human decision-making is
often more emotional and irrational than we'd like to believe. Voss
grounds his approach in Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's foundational
research on behavioral economics and cognitive psychology. The specific
concepts highlighted in the book are: cognitive biases, the framing
effect, loss aversion, system 1 and system 2 thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cognitive biases: People are not purely rational actors. Instead,
our decisions are influenced by systematic, unconscious, and irrational
mental shortcuts.</li>
<li>The framing effect: People respond differently to the same choice
depending on how it's presented or "framed." For example, framing a
negotiation in terms of what the other party stands to lose is often
more powerful than framing it in terms of what they stand to gain.</li>
<li>Loss aversion: A core tenet of Prospect Theory, this principle
states that the psychological pain of a loss is roughly twice as
powerful as the pleasure of an equivalent gain.</li>
<li>System 1 and system 2 thinking: Introduced in Kahneman's book,
<em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, this model describes two distinct
modes of thought. System 1 is our fast, instinctive, and emotional mind.
System 2 is our slow, deliberate, and logical mind. Voss's techniques
are designed to bypass the logical System 2 and appeal directly to the
emotional and intuitive System 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>The central tenets of Chris Voss's effective negotiation strategy are
rooted in emotional intelligence and a shift from a competitive to a
collaborative mindset. Rather than seeking a compromise, his methods
focus on understanding the other party to influence their
decision-making. The key elements of his approach include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tactical empathy: intentionally using empathy to understand the
other person's perspective, emotions, and motivations. The goal is to
build a trust-based relationship, not necessarily to agree with
them.</li>
<li>Active learning: it's important to truly listen to what the other
person is saying, rather than just waiting for your turn to speak. This
includes paying attention to their words, tone, and body language, to
uncover their real needs and fears.</li>
<li>Calibrated questions: open-ended questions that start with 'how' or
'what', and are designed to give the other person the illusion of
control while you guide them toward a solution that benefits both
sides.</li>
<li>Key techniques:
<ul>
<li>Mirroring: repeating the last one to three key words of what the
other person has said. This encourages them to elaborate and creates a
sense of rapport.</li>
<li>Labeling: verbally identifying the acknowledging the other person's
emotions. This helps to diffuse negative emotions and makes them feel
heard.</li>
<li>The power of 'no': 'no' is not a failure but a critical starting
point. It makes the other party feel safe and in control, and it allows
you to get past insincere agreements to uncover the true issues.</li>
<li>"That's right" as the goal: Instead of aiming for "yes," the
ultimate goal is to get the other person to say, "That's right." This
phrase signifies that they feel you have accurately understood their
position and worldview, creating a turning point in the
negotiation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Other impressive key lessons to remember:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Be ready for possible surprises, and use skills to reveal the
surprises</li>
<li>View assumptions as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them
rigorously</li>
<li>Negotiation is not a battle but a process of discovery with the goal
of uncovering as much information as possible</li>
<li>Let the person be in a positive frame of mind. Positivity creates
mental agility in both you and your counterpart</li>
<li>Keep voice calm and slow. Create an aura of authority and
trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness</li>
<li>Use positive / playful voice as default. Use direct or assertive
voice rarely</li>
<li>Acknowledging the other person's situation to convey that you are
listening</li>
<li>Focus first on clearing the barriers to agreement</li>
<li>Pause and let the other party to fill in the silence</li>
<li>Label your counterpart's fears to diffuse their power and generate
safety, well-being, and trust</li>
<li>Accusation audit: List the worst things that the other party could
say about you and say them before the other person can</li>
<li>All negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires
and needs</li>
<li>Don't compromise. Meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both
sides</li>
<li>Approaching deadlines entice people to rush the negotiating process
and do impulsive things that againt their best interests</li>
<li>Before you make an offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how bad
it will be. When you get to numbers, set an extreme anchor to make your
'real' offer seem reasonable, or usse a range to seem less
aggressive.</li>
<li>People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a
gain.</li>
<li>Avoid asking questions that can be answered by 'yes'. Ask calibrated
questions that start with the words 'how' or 'what'. Avoid asking
questions starting with 'why' which is always an accusation in any
language.</li>
<li>Calibrate questions to point your counterpart toward solving your
problems.</li>
<li>There is always a team on the other side. You are vulnerable if you
don't influence those behind the table.</li>
<li>Asking 'how' question gives counterpart an illusion of control and
leads them to contemplate yoru problems when making their demand.</li>
<li>Identify the motivations of players 'behind the table'. You can do
so by asking how a deal will affect everybody else and how on board they
are.</li>
<li>Pay 38% attention to tone of voice and 55% to body language. The
rest 7% is on words.</li>
<li>Test whether 'yes' is real or counterfeit by using calibrated
questions, summaries, and labels to get your counterpart to reaffirm
their agreement at least three times.</li>
<li>Pay attention to a person's use of pronouns which offers deep
insights into his or her relative authority. If you are hearing a lot of
'I', 'me', and 'my', the real power to decide probably lies elsewhere.
Picking up a lot of 'we', 'they', and 'them', it's more likely you are
dealing directly with a savvy decision maker keeping his options
open.</li>
<li>Humor and humanity are the best ways to break the ice and remove
roadblocks.</li>
<li>Identify your counterpart's negotiation style: Accomodator,
Assertive, or Analyst.</li>
<li>Prepare dodging tactics to avoid getting sucked into the compromise
trap.</li>
<li>Learn to take a punch or punch back without anger. The guy across
the table is not the problem, the situation is.</li>
<li>Prepare an Ackerman plan:
<ol type="1">
<li>Set you target price (goal)</li>
<li>Set your first offer at 65% of your target price</li>
<li>Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85%, 95%, and
100%)</li>
<li>Use lots of empath and different ways of saying 'No' to getthe other
side to counter before you increase your offer</li>
<li>when calculating the final amount, use precise, non round numbers
like, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and
weight.</li>
<li>On your final number, throw in a non monetary item (that they
probably don't want) to show you are at your limit.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Black swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the three types of
leverages: positive (the ability to give someone what they want);
negative (the ability to hurt someone); and normative (using your
counterpart's norms to bring them around).</li>
<li>Understand the other side's 'religion / worldview' (reason for
being) so that we are able to speak persuasively, develop options that
resonate for them, and build influence. Black swan usually dwells in the
hidden negotiation space.</li>
<li>People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural
similarity with.</li>
<li>Get face time with the counterpart.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Selected Quotes</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What good negotiators do when labeling is to address those underlying
emotions. Labeling negatives diffuses them (or defuses them, in extreme
cases); labeling positives reinforces them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great negotiators seek 'No' because they know that's often when the
real negotiation begins.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether you call it "buy-in" or 'engagement' or something else, good
negotiators know that their job isn't to put on a great performance but
to gently guide their counterpart to discover their goal as his own.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never split the difference. Creative solutions are almost always
preceded by some degree of risk, annoyance, confusion, and conflict.
Accommodation and compromise produce none of that. You've got to embrace
the hard stuff. That's where the great deals are. And that's what great
negotiators do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can get the other party to reveal their problems, pain, and
unmet objectives - if you can get at what people are really buying -
then you can sell them a vision of their problem that leaves your
proposal as the perfect solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are selling yourself to a manager, sell yourself as more
than a body for a job; sell yourself, and your success, as a way they
can validate their own intelligence and broadcast it to the rest of the
company. Make sure they know you'll act as a flesh-and-blood argument
for their importance.</p>
<p>The key issue here is if someone gives you guidance, they will watch
you to see if you follow their advice. They will have a personal stake
in seeing you succeed. You've just recruited your first unofficial
mentor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Negotiation was coaxing, not overcoming; co-opting, not defeating.
Most importantly, successful negotiation involved getting your
counterpart to do the work for you and suggest your solution himself. It
involved giving him the illusion of control while you, in fact, were the
one defining the conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking for help in this manner (give illusion of control by asking
calibrated questions), after you've already been engaged ina dialogue,
is an incredibly powerful negotiating technique for transforming
encounters from confrontational showdowns into joint problem-solving
sessions. And calibrated questions are the best tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Expression of anger increase a negotiator's advantage and final take.
Anger shows passion and conviction that can help sway the other side to
accept less. However, by heightening your counterpart's sensitivity to
danger and fear, your anger reduces the resources they have for other
cognitive activity, setting them up to make bad concessions that will
likely lead to implementation problems, thus reducing your gains.</p>
<p>Also beware: researchers have also found that disingenuous
expressions of unfelt anger - faking it - backfire, leading to
inractable demadns and destroying trust. For anger to be effective, it
has to be real, the key for it is to be under control because anger also
reduces our cognitive ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No deal is better than a bad deal. Once you're clear on what you
bottom line s, you have to be willing to walk away. Never be needy for a
deal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of punching back and boundary-setting tactics as a flattened
S-curve: you've accelerated up the slope of a negotiation and hit a
plateau that requires you to temporarily stop any progress, escalate or
de-escalate the issue acting as the obstable, and eventually bring the
relationship backto a state of rapport and get back on the slope. Taking
a positive, constructive approach to conflict involves understanding
that the bond is fundamental to any resolution. Never create an
enemy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By positioning your demands within the worldview your conuterpart
uses to make decisions, you show them respect and that gets your
attention and results. Knowing your counterpart's religion is more than
just gaining normative leverage per se. Rather, it's gaining a holistic
understanding of your counterpart's worldview and using that knowledge
to inform your negotiating moves.</p>
<p>Two tips for reading religion correctly:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Review everything you hear</li>
<li>Use backup listeners whose only job is to listen between the lines.
They will hear things you miss.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you recognize that your counterpart is not irrational, but
simply ill-informed, constrained, or obeying interests that you do not
yet know, your field of movement greatly expands. And that allows you to
negotiate much more effectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Art of 'No':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saying "No" gives the speaker the feeling of safety, security, and
control. You use a question that prompts a "No" answer, and your
counterpart feels that by turningyou down hehas proved that he's in the
driver's seat. Good negotiators welcome - even invite - a solid "No" to
start, as a sign that the other party is engaged and thinking.</p>
<p>Gun for a "Yes" straight off the bat, though, and your counterpart
gets defensive, wary,and skittish. That's why I tell my students that,
if you are trying to sell something, don't start with "Doyou have a few
minutes to talk?" Instead ask, "Is now a bad time to talk?" Either you
get "Yes, it's a bad time" followed by a good time or a request to go
away, or you get "No, it's not" and total focus.</p>
<p>It's a reaffirmation of autonomy. It is not a use or abuse of power;
it is not an act of rejection; it is not a manifestation of
stubbornness; it is not the end of the negotiation.</p>
<p>"No" has a lot of skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>"No" allows the real issues to be brought forth</li>
<li>"No" protects people from making - and lets them correct -
ineffective decisions</li>
<li>"No" slows things down so that people can freely embrace their
decisions and the agreements they enter into</li>
<li>"No" helps people feel safe, secure, emotionally comfortable, and in
control of their decisions</li>
<li>"No" moves everyone's efforts forward</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a big difference between making your counterpart feel that
they can say "No" and actually getting them to say it. Sometimes, if you
are talking to somebody who is just not listening, the only way you can
crack their cranium is to antagonize them into "No".</p>
<p>One great way to do this is to mislabel one of the other party's
emotions or desires. You say something that you know is totally wrong.
That forces them to listen and makes them comfortable correcting
you.</p>
<p>Another way to force "No" in a negotiation is to ask the other party
what they don't want. People are comfortable saying "No" here because it
feels like self-protection. And once you've gotten them to say "No",
people are much more open to moving forward toward new options and
ideas.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Actionable Insights for Individual Developers</strong></p>
<p>To successfully transition into the role of an AI Collaborator or
Strategist, developers must focus on strategic adoption and skill
augmentation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Embrace Experimentation and Iterate Aggressively</li>
<li>Achieve AI Fluency: Commit to continuous learning and adaptability
to understand the capabilities and constraints of different AI tools,
platforms, and models given the "breakneck" speed of innovation.</li>
<li>Shift Focus to Delegation and Orchestration: Move from writing code
to architecting and verifying.</li>
<li>Prioritize Verification and Quality Control: developers must
rigorously review, test, and verify AI-generated code.</li>
<li>Maintain Deep Foundational Knowledge: Continue to deepen
understanding of programming basics, algorithms, data structures, and
overall software systems.</li>
<li>Elevate Systems and Product Thinking: Adopt a hybrid mindset that
incorporates engineering, design, and product management.</li>
<li>Increase Ambition View AI tools as a way to raise the ceiling of
achievable outcomes and expand scope, rather than merely focusing on
"time saved" or reducing effort.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Actionable Insights for Strategy and Tool
Development</strong></p>
<p>For companies and those building future tools, the focus should be on
redefining success and ensuring the developer experience is
fulfilling:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Update Success Metrics: Measure the ability to raise the ceiling of
the work and outcomes accomplished (increasing ambition).</li>
<li>Invest in Advanced Capabilities: Recognize that achieving ambitious,
expanded scopes requires investing in the most advanced agentic
capabilities.</li>
<li>Ensure Fulfillment During Transition: Tool builders should design
future tools to be intuitive, delightful, and cater to developers’
curiosity to keep them fulfilled and happy during the transition
period.</li>

<p>While AI tools like GitHub Copilot significantly boost coding speed,
human critical thinking and fundamental developer skills remain
essential for building resilient, scalable, and secure software. There

excellence in pull requests, thorough code reviews, and investment in
clear documentation.</p>

<p>The author argues that Seemingly Conscious AI (SCAI) is an inevitable
and unwelcome outcome given current technological capabilities, warning
that the illusion of consciousness could lead people to dangerously
advocate for AI rights, welfare, and even citizenship, leading to
societal polarization and psychological risks. The essay emphasizes the
urgent need for clear guardrails and design principles in the AI
industry to ensure that AI companions remain tools maximizing human
utility while actively minimizing markers of consciousness.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>AI psychosis - users develop delusions or distorted beliefs after
extensive use of chatbots like ChatGPT. Those with a personal or family
history of psychosis, or those with personality traits susceptible to
fringe beliefs, may be more vulnerable. Extended use, often hours every
day, is a significant risk factor. Experts advise users to view AI
chatbots as tools, not friends, and to avoid relying on them for
emotional support. They recommend that companies collect more data, work
with mental health professionals, and build safeguards directly into
their models, such as prompting users to take breaks or issuing "warning
labels."</p>

<p><em>A key part of being a lifelong learner is retaining what you are

<p><em>I choose a certain number of topics/books that I want to

deliberately.</em></p>
<p><em>I find reading to be a more positive habit than scrolling
mindlessly on my phone or watching YouTube videos. I do those things as

Deeply</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ryandhall.substack.com/p/how-to-remember-what-you-read">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ryan Hall's top five tips for retaining more of what you are
reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Underline or highlight key ideas or phrases</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When reading deeply, always have a pen or highlighter in hand.</li>
<li>On the first read-through, underline or highlight any key concepts,
ideas, characters, or quotes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This practice makes the reader interactive with the text and enables
quick review of key concepts after reading. Reviewing these key ideas
after finishing a chapter is helpful and increases focus as you actively
look for points to underline.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Write in books</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>As you read and underline, write notes in the margins. These notes
can include key ideas, questions, or indications if you don't understand
a section or disagree with something.</li>
<li>Notes are often single words or short phrases, like "Habit Stacking"
when reading <em>Atomic Habits</em>. These words stand out when you
revisit a section or chapter, keeping your mind engaged.</li>
<li>For digital readers (like on a Kindle), keep a notes app open on
your phone to jot down words or phrases related to the chapter. (A
separate source comment also notes that Kindles allow unlimited marginal
notes without needing a separate app).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Briefly summarize each section or chapter immediately
after you have read it</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a notebook for reading notes, where you can write the date,
book title, and chapter. Highlighting different books with different
colors can help distinguish ideas from various books.</li>
<li>Immediately after finishing a chapter or section, briefly summarize
it in your own words, keeping it short (1-3 sentences). Putting ideas
into your own words helps formulate thoughts and allows you to test your
understanding of the concepts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Talk to others or teach someone else</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell someone else about what you are reading and learning. This
verbal processing forces your mind to recall what you have read and put
the pieces together, leading to greater retention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Write reviews or summaries</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>After finishing a book, write a review or a summary. It doesn't need
to be elaborate; the goal is to start the process of putting thoughts on
paper or keyboard to let your mind work through what you've learned. Try
to recall key plot points, ideas, and quotes, referencing your notebook
notes and margin annotations.</li>
<li>Summarize what you've read and ideas you'd like to incorporate into
your life. For nonfiction, try to apply one idea into your life. Another
comment also suggests writing a summary paragraph of each chapter and
then summarizing those in a review.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, bonus tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Re-read classic or deeper non-fiction books</strong>, as
they are often meant to be revisited and "wrestled with".</li>
<li><strong>Listen to podcasts or interviews with the author</strong>
(especially for nonfiction) after reading the book, as authors may
provide more context or better explanations in an interview format.</li>

<p><strong>Write Everything Down (and not in your notes app) - Megan,
Typewriter Time</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://moooshh.substack.com/p/write-everything-down-and-not-in">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author found that digital notes were easily forgotten and lacked
the tangible connection and memory associated with handwriting. By
shifting to a dedicated creative writing notebook, the author
experienced improved recall, a more thoughtful writing process, and a
stronger connection to their ideas and progress. The piece advocates for
the benefits of physical writing for creative endeavors and personal
reflection, highlighting how it fosters a deeper engagement with one's
own thoughts and creations, a sentiment echoed by the included
comments.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to handwriting everything in notebooks instead of using your
phone.</li>
<li>Use a dedicated notebook for creative writing only.</li>
<li>Write down ideas and pieces by hand.</li>
<li>Constantly flip back through the pages of your physical
notebook.</li>
<li>Write out observations about your growth and areas for improvement
directly within the same notebook.</li>
<li>Create an index in your notebook so you can find things easily.</li>
<li>Tab pages of importance.</li>
<li>Scratch out things when you're stuck or frustrated. This allows for
a "messy and alive" notebook that reflects the organic nature of the
creative process, unlike the clean digital interface.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Context engineering components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systemic Approach:</strong> It's a system, not a one-off
prompt, where the final prompt is woven together programmatically from
multiple components (e.g., role instruction, user query, fetched data,
examples).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic and Situation-Specific:</strong> Context assembly
happens per request, adapting to the query or conversation state. This
involves including different information depending on the situation,
such as a summary of a multi-turn conversation or a relevant excerpt
from a document.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Blending Multiple Content Types:</strong> It covers
instructional context (prompts, guidance, examples), knowledge context
(domain information, facts via retrieval), and tools context
(information from tool outputs like web searches or database
queries).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Format and Clarity:</strong> It's about <em>how</em>
information is presented, not just <em>what</em> is included. This means
compressing and structuring information for the model's comprehension,
using formatting like bullet points, headings, JSON, or pseudo-code, and
labeling sections (e.g., "Relevant documentation:").</li>

<p><strong>Suggestions</strong>:</p>

<li>Mimic generally competent individuals for new tasks</li>
<li>Ignore existing standards and aspire to a higher level: Recognize
that many skills are "pre-competitive," meaning current standards don't

seen, rather than just slightly better than those around you. This
involves a commitment to rigorous effort and exploration beyond
perceived limits.</li>

<p><strong>Techniques to maintain the creative state</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ritualistic work habits: Establishing consistent routines for
creative work (e.g., daily writing sessions at a specific time and
place) can induce a state akin to self-hypnosis, fostering a
non-judgmental zone.</li>
<li>Delaying exposure: Introducing a long delay between creation and
public presentation can reduce self-censorship, as the creator feels
detached from immediate judgment.</li>
<li>Viewing work in religious terms: Framing the creative process as a
service to a higher power can provide the necessary awe and daring to
push into the unknown.</li>
<li>Strategic collaboration: Working with supportive, open-minded
collaborators who challenge rather than conform can be beneficial.</li>
<li>Subverting expectations: Actively seeking out ideas or approaches
that feel slightly uncomfortable or that one might be "ashamed of
liking" can lead to truly original work.</li>
<li>Working at speed: Forcing oneself to produce work rapidly can bypass
self-censorship and allow raw, unfiltered ideas to emerge.</li>

<p><strong>Where do Tech Returns Come From? - Eric Flaningam, Generative
Value</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.generativevalue.com/p/where-do-tech-returns-come-from">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article suggests that successful technology investing requires
embracing uncertainty, understanding the "base rates" of different
company categories, recognizing where true differentiation lies (often
beyond just technology), viewing market size from a first-principles
perspective, and being aware of the unique opportunities unlocked by new
technology waves.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The next <span class="math inline">\(\$100B\)</span> company
will not look like the last:</strong> Value in technology is driven by
"anomalous" companies founded by "anomalous" people, making pattern
matching ineffective. The most successful companies create new
categories.</li>
<li><strong>Know the game you’re playing:</strong> Different categories
have different "Slugging Ratios" (Value/Company). Consumer companies,
often network-driven marketplaces with winner-take-all dynamics, have
the highest upside, while Hardtech companies also have high slugging
ratios but are riskier. Enterprise software, while less "Power Lawed,"
offers more predictable returns and is suitable for an expanding venture
capital landscape due to its scalability, moats, and lower operating
costs.</li>
<li><strong>Software is like chicken, 80% of it tastes the
same:</strong> Technical differentiation in enterprise software is often
nuanced. Sales, marketing, and building "mindshare" are as, if not more,
important than technical moats, especially as software becomes easier to
build and features are quickly replicated. The "GPT Wrapper" argument
for AI applications is analogous to how many successful enterprise
software companies were essentially "database wrappers."</li>
<li><strong>“Market size” may be the single greatest reason for
investors missing great companies:</strong> Humans struggle with
uncertainty, and new markets introduce exactly that. Many successful
companies like Palantir, Shopify, and Uber created new markets that
didn't exist before, leading to investors underestimating their
potential market size. Companies with "multiple-expansion tailwinds" and
strong platforms also tend to be underestimated.</li>
<li><strong>Companies resemble the technology waves they ride in
on:</strong> New technology waves (internet, mobile, cloud, AI) unlock
the ability for new businesses to exist. AI, for example, is enabling
anyone to create software and automate voice/text-based workflows,
expanding the market significantly and allowing for the creation of
entirely new categories (e.g., legal software companies like Harvey
reaching <span class="math inline">\(\$5B\)</span>+ valuations
quickly).</li>
<li><strong>Don't underestimate the Power Law, ever:</strong> While
mentioned throughout, this point emphasizes the extreme concentration of
value in a very small number of companies. The article states that the
top seven companies in its dataset accounted for nearly 50% of the <span
class="math inline">\(\$13\)</span> trillion in value creation.</li>

<p><strong>The Great Mental Models: Visual Book Summary -
DoubleThink</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dblthink.substack.com/p/the-great-mental-models-visual-book">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Map is Not The Territory:</strong> This model highlights
that maps (including mental models) simplify reality and are imperfect
reductions of what they represent. While useful, they lack perfect
fidelity and should be used carefully, as the real world is complex.</p>
<p><strong>Circle of Competence:</strong> Emphasizes the importance of
knowing what you know and, critically, what you don't know. It's
dangerous to incorrectly assume knowledge. The advice is to operate
within your area of expertise and outsource the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Falsifiability:</strong> States that for a theory to be
confirmed, it must be challengeable. Instead of trying to prove a theory
correct, one should try to prove it incorrect. A theory becomes stronger
when rigorous experimentation fails to disprove it.</p>
<p><strong>First Principles Thinking:</strong> Involves breaking down a
problem into its fundamental, non-reducible parts to challenge
pre-existing assumptions. It's an effective way to clarify and approach
complex problems by building solutions from the bottom up, often using
techniques like Socratic Questioning and the Five Whys.</p>
<p><strong>Thought Experiment:</strong> Refers to mentally simulating
situations to test theories or reach conclusions, rather than conducting
physical experiments. It allows for gaining confidence in answers, as
illustrated by comparing hypothetical basketball games.</p>
<p><strong>Necessity and Sufficiency:</strong> Explains that having all
necessary conditions does not guarantee all sufficient conditions are
met. Meeting necessary conditions might make success possible, but it
doesn't assure it (e.g., knowing how to write vs. being a New York Times
Bestseller).</p>
<p><strong>Second-Order Thinking:</strong> Encourages looking beyond
immediate consequences to consider the "consequence of the consequence"
or further. It involves thinking several steps ahead to avoid short-term
positive decisions that lead to long-term negative effects.</p>
<p><strong>Probabilistic Thinking</strong>: Acknowledges that the future
cannot be predicted perfectly, but this model helps improve the accuracy
of guesses using three main concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bayesian Thinking:</strong> Using all relevant prior
information for informed decisions in unfamiliar scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Fat-Tailed Curves:</strong> Understanding that the more
extreme scenarios are possible, the higher the likelihood of any one of
them occurring.</li>
<li><strong>Asymmetries:</strong> Assessing the probability that your
estimates accurately reflect the real world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correlation vs. Causation:</strong> Highlights that a
correlation between two things does not necessarily mean one causes the
other. Large datasets can yield strong correlations purely by chance, as
demonstrated by the unrelated alignment of Walgreens customer
satisfaction and Russell Crowe's movie appearances.</p>
<p><strong>Inversion Principle:</strong> A thinking tool that involves
approaching a situation from the opposite end of the usual starting
point to reframe a problem into a solution (e.g., "make money" becomes
"avoid going into debt").</p>
<p><strong>Hanlon’s Razor:</strong> Suggests that one should "never
attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by
stupidity." It implies that actions that seem ill-intended are often
accidents or misunderstandings, and the explanation assuming the least
intent is most likely correct.</p>
<p><strong>Occam’s Razor:</strong> States that when multiple
explanations are possible, the one that makes the fewest assumptions is
generally the most probable and closest to the truth. In essence, the
simplest explanation is usually the correct one.</p>

<p><strong>Tesla: From Bad to Worse - App Economy Insights</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.appeconomyinsights.com/p/tesla-from-bad-to-worse">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the <strong>EV Landscape</strong> (specifically Tesla's automotive
business):</p>
<ul>
<li>The author highlights that Tesla's year is going "from bad to
worse". Global deliveries have fallen by 13%, marking their steepest
quarterly drop ever.</li>
<li>Tesla's revenue is declining, margins are compressing, and cash flow
has dried out. Automotive revenue specifically fell by 16%
year-over-year. The author notes that "Q2 results remain very poor" if
Tesla is viewed purely as an auto business.</li>
<li>Historically strong margins, supported by gigafactory scale,
direct-to-consumer sales, and minimal marketing costs, are now being
eroded by price cuts and rising competition.</li>
<li>A return to growth, which was predicted earlier in the year, now
"looks unlikely". The company has also withheld full-year guidance due
to factors like trade policy and political backlash, adding to the
uncertainty.</li>
<li>The author expresses concern about "mounting evidence of brand
erosion".</li>
</ul>
<p>On the <strong>AV Landscape</strong> (specifically Tesla's Robotaxi
program):</p>
<ul>
<li>The author acknowledges that Tesla's robotaxi program "could unlock
tremendous value". Elon Musk himself emphasizes that "autonomy is the
story" for Tesla.</li>
<li>Despite its significant potential, the author cautions that even if
these "moonshots in robotaxi and robotics succeed," they are "years away
from offsetting collapsing vehicle demand". This indicates that the
robotaxi program is not seen as an immediate solution to Tesla's current
financial woes in its automotive segment.</li>
<li>The robotaxi program faces considerable regulatory hurdles.</li>
<li>The author raises a critical question about whether the ongoing
"brand erosion" could "undermine even the most ambitious upside" of the
robotaxi program.</li>
<li>The author foresees an "upcoming robotaxi war" among Big Tech
companies, suggesting a highly competitive environment for autonomous
vehicles.</li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Figma's Current State and Potential:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The author asserts that Figma is "not just a great product—it’s a
great business" and describes its growth since monetizing in 2017 as
"one of the most explosive runs in SaaS history".</li>
<li>Figma achieved <strong>$ $749$ million in FY24 revenue, up 48%
year-over-year</strong>, with <strong>over 1,000 customers paying <span
class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span>K+ annually</strong>, and
<strong>95% of Fortune 500 companies using Figma</strong>. The author
considers its product-led, freemium "Land and Expand" growth model to be
"hard to manufacture—and even harder to replicate".</li>
<li>The author highlights Figma's transformation "from a design tool
into a full-stack product platform". It is "evolving into a full product
development suite", with new tools like FigJam, Dev Mode, and Figma Make
(AI-driven prototyping) expanding its reach across the entire product
lifecycle.</li>
<li>Figma is positioned as a "productivity platform disguised as a
design tool", which, in the author's view, separates it "from legacy
tools and what opens the door to much broader enterprise budgets" by
serving designers, engineers, product managers, marketers, and
executives.</li>
<li>Figma's "web-first" and "multiplayer by default" approach gave it a
"distinct edge over incumbents like Adobe".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Figma's Uncertainty and Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The author notes the <strong>collapse of the <span
class="math inline">\(\$20\)</span> billion Adobe acquisition due to
"antitrust concerns in the US, UK, and Europe"</strong>. While Figma
received a "<span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> billion breakup
fee" and regained independence, this past scrutiny highlights a
challenging regulatory environment that companies of Figma's scale can
face.</li>
<li>The author points out a significant "catch" in Figma's reported net
dollar retention of 132% in Q1 FY25. They state that the metric "only
includes customers still spending over <span
class="math inline">\(\$10,000\)</span> today, then looks back at what
those same customers were spending a year ago." This indicates a
potential lack of clarity or transparency in how a key growth metric is
presented, which could be an uncertainty for investors trying to assess
actual customer retention.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Karen Hao, an expert in mechanical engineering and journalism,
provides a comprehensive critique of the A industry, detailing her
opinions, arguments, and proposals across various topics during the
interview.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Understanding AI and its Definition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao argues that the term "artificial intelligence" is poorly defined
and was originally coined in 1956 by John McCarthy to attract more
attention and funding for his research, essentially as a marketing term.
She notes that while AI generally refers to recreating human
intelligence in computers, there is no scientific consensus on what
human intelligence is, contributing to the term's ambiguity.</li>
<li>AI serves as an "umbrella" term encompassing various technologies
that simulate human behaviors or tasks, ranging from Siri to ChatGPT,
which operate on vastly different scales and have different use cases.
Hao uses the analogy that AI is like the word "transportation" to
illustrate its vagueness: just as "transportation" can refer to bicycles
or rockets, AI can refer to vastly different technologies with different
purposes and costs. She finds it frustrating and unproductive when
politicians use the term vaguely, suggesting it means "progress" without
specifying the type of AI or its potential costs, which she compares to
promoting rockets for commuting when more efficient alternatives
exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Environmental and Public Health Costs of AI
Development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao emphasizes that the resource consumption required to develop and
use generative AI models is quite extraordinary. She cites a McKinsey
report projecting that within the next five years, current data center
and supercomputer expansion for AI will require adding around half to
1.2 times the amount of energy consumed in the UK annually to the global
grid. A significant portion of this energy will be serviced by fossil
fuels, including natural gas and the extended lives of coal plants.</li>
<li>Hao highlights that this acceleration not only impacts the climate
crisis but also exacerbates public health crises, citing Elon Musk's
xAI's Colossus in Memphis, Tennessee, which is powered by 35 unlicensed
methane gas turbines pumping toxic air pollutants into the community.
She argues that "unlicensed" means the company completely ignored
existing environmental regulations.</li>
<li>She stresses the undertalked about issue of water consumption: AI
data centers require fresh, potable water for cooling to prevent
corrosion and bacterial growth, often using public drinking water
infrastructure. She notes that two-thirds of new AI data centers are
being built in water-scarce areas, providing the example of Montevideo,
Uruguay, where Google proposed a data center during a historic
drought.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Business Case and Ideology Driving AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao contends that the business case for AI is currently unclear,
noting that even Microsoft has started pulling back investments in data
centers and its CEO, Satya Nadella, has expressed skepticism about the
"race to AGI". She argues that what drives the fervor in the absence of
a clear business case is an ideology or a "quasi-religious fervor".
People genuinely believe in the ability to fundamentally recreate human
intelligence, seeing it as the most important civilizational goal.</li>
<li>She explains that this ideological drive from startups like OpenAI
and Anthropic pressures larger, more traditional tech giants to invest
heavily, as shareholders demand an AI strategy, often due to consumer
shifts (like using ChatGPT as search). Hao explains that OpenAI's pitch
to investors is that funding could lead to being the first to AGI for
"the biggest returns you've ever seen" or, failing that, could automate
human tasks to replace labor, generating significant returns.</li>
<li>She warns of a "bandwagon mentality" among investors. Crucially, she
highlights that if the AI bubble pops, the risk is not just for Silicon
Valley but will have ripple effects across the global economy, as
investments often come from public endowments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>OpenAI's Origins and Sam Altman's Leadership</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao reveals that OpenAI started as a nonprofit in late 2015,
co-founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman, as an "anti-Google" initiative
to conduct fundamental AI research without commercial pressures. Musk
specifically feared Google's DeepMind could lead to AI going "very badly
wrong" (sentience, harming humans). The original "open" in OpenAI stood
for open source, and for its first year, the company genuinely
open-sourced its code and research. Hao speculates that the nonprofit
status was a recruitment tool to attract talent, as they couldn't
compete with Google's salaries but could offer a compelling sense of
mission. However, within less than a year, the bottleneck shifted from
talent to capital, leading to the decision to convert to a for-profit
entity. This shift also led to a falling out between Musk and Altman
over who would be CEO.</li>
<li>Regarding Sam Altman, Hao portrays him as a "master manipulator" and
"understander of human psychology". She notes that Altman was not
publicly well-known but was a critical "lynchpin" within the tech
industry, having cultivated relationships with powerful networks and
policymakers early in his career as president of Y Combinator. Hao
states that people who worked with Altman consistently told her they
didn't know what he truly believed because he would often say he
believed what the person he was talking to believed, even if those
beliefs were diametrically opposed. She concludes that Altman's
comparative advantages as a leader include his ability to persuade
people to join his "quest," acquire necessary resources (capital, land,
energy, water, laws), and instill a powerful sense of belief in his
vision among his team. She describes his work as being most effective in
one-on-one meetings where he can tailor his message to achieve his
goals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Critique of Big Tech as a Corporate Empire</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao argues that if allowed to expand unfettered, these corporate
empires will ultimately erode democracy. Hao states that tech leaders
view the rest of the world, including other Western countries, as
"resources"—territories from which to acquire land, labor, minerals,
energy, and water for their data centers. She highlights that data
center expansion often targets economically vulnerable communities in
rural areas of the US and UK, which are often uninformed about the true
costs, such as bans on new housing construction due to massive
electricity consumption, or the depletion of fresh water supplies. Hao
laments that politicians are often unaware of these negative
consequences.</li>
<li>She argues that the idea that "you need colossal data centers to
build AI systems" is a "false trade-off". Before OpenAI, AI research was
trending towards "tiny AI systems" requiring little computational
resources, showing that AI innovation can occur without these massive,
resource-intensive approaches. Hao points out that most AI experts today
are employed by these companies, which she likens to climate scientists
being bankrolled by oil and gas companies, leading to biased information
that serves the company's interests rather than scientific
grounding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Exploitative Labor Practices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao exposes grueling exploitative practices in the global AI supply
chain, particularly regarding content moderation for OpenAI. Kenyan
workers were contracted to sift through "reams of the worst text on the
internet," including child sexual abuse, hate speech, and violent
content, to build content moderation filters for ChatGPT. She details
how this work traumatized workers, causing PTSD, personality changes,
and family breakdowns, like the story of Moffat, whose family left him
due to his changed demeanor. These workers were paid only a few dollars
an hour.</li>
<li>She also discusses data annotation, a long-standing part of the AI
industry. Venezuelan refugees in Colombia, highly educated but desperate
due to their country's economic crisis, became cheap labor for labeling
data for self-driving cars and retail platforms. Hao describes the
structural exploitation where workers compete for tasks on platforms,
leading to immense anxiety and control over their lives, exemplified by
a woman who wouldn't walk outside during weekdays for fear of missing
tasks and would wake up at 3 AM if an alarm signaled a new task. She
asserts that there is no moral justification for why these workers,
whose contributions are critical, are paid pennies while company
insiders receive multi-million dollar compensation packages; the only
"justification" is an ideological one that some people are
superior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Proposals for Public Action and Shaping the Future of
AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao believes that anyone in the world can take action to shape the
AI development trajectory. She proposes thinking of AI development as a
"full supply chain of AI development", where various resources (data,
land, energy, water) and deployment spaces (schools, hospitals, offices)
are points of democratic contestation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>She suggests the public can reclaim ownership over resources. She
encourages people to contest the spaces where AI is deployed. Hao also
advises people to research AI technologies and vendors to make informed
choices about which AI systems to use.</p></li>
<li><p>She expresses optimism that widespread, democratic contestation
at every stage of the AI development and deployment pipeline can
"reverse the imperial conquest of these companies" and lead to a more
broadly beneficial trajectory for AI.</p></li>

<p>I finished reading Peter Thiel's '<em>Zero to One: Notes on Startups,
or How to Build the Future</em>' today. With the rapid advancements and
widespread discussion around AI, the core arguments about technology,
human-machine collaboration, and the nature of progress hold up
remarkably well. And in some ways, as a manifesto for building a better
future, what's written in this book is even more relevant now.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2 Party Like It's 1999</strong> outlines four lessons
learned from the dot-com crash that became 'dogma' in the startup world,
however, Thiel argues that these dogmas are largely incorrect and that
the opposite principles are probably more correct:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Make incremental advances:</strong> Grand visions were
seen as bubble-inflating, so small, incremental steps became the
preferred path.</p>
<p>Thiel: It is better to risk boldness than triviality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stay lean and flexible:</strong> Planning was deemed
arrogant, and "agnostic experimentation" became the norm.</p>
<p>Thiel: A bad plan is better than no plan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improve on the competition:</strong> Focus on existing
customers and recognizable products, improving on what competitors
already offer.</p>
<p>Thiel: Competitive markets destroy profits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus on product, not sales:</strong> If a product
requires advertising or salespeople, it's not good enough; viral growth
is the only sustainable growth.</p>
<p>Thiel: Sales matters just as much as product.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd, but to
think for yourself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this end this chapter, Thiel is challenging the reader to not
simply adopt the prevailing "lessons learned" from the past, but to
critically evaluate them. He suggests that true contrarianism isn't just
about disagreeing with the majority for the sake of it, but about
independent thought and forming your own conclusions, even if those
conclusions align with or contradict the crowd. It's about genuine
intellectual autonomy.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chapter 3 All Happy Companies Are Different</strong>, he
argues that successful companies are unique and that true value comes
from creating a monopoly rather than competing in existing markets.
Thiel uses the economic models of "perfect competition" and "monopoly"
to explain this difference. In perfect competition, firms sell identical
products, have no market power, and thus, in the long run, make no
economic profit as new entrants drive prices down. A monopoly,
conversely, owns its market, allowing it to set prices and maximize
profits due to a lack of close substitutes. He asserts that competition
is destructive, leading to a ruthless struggle for survival and zero
profits. Monopolies, on the other hand, can afford to focus on long-term
innovation, employee well-being, and broader societal impact because
they are not constantly battling for survival. Creative monopolies are
powerful engines for progress as they introduce entirely new categories
of abundance to the world.</p>
<p>He then discusses how both monopolists and non-monopolists tend to
misrepresent their market conditions. Monopolists (like Google) downplay
their dominance by broadly defining their market to avoid scrutiny,
while non-monopolists (like a new restaurant owner) narrowly define
their market to appear unique and avoid acknowledging intense
competition. Thiel emphasizes that losing sight of competitive reality
by focusing on trivial differentiators is a fatal mistake for
startups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by
solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed
to escape competition."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the core message from the book. Entrepreneurs should strive
to build unique, monopolistic businesses by creating something entirely
new.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 primarily focuses on the economic and strategic advantages
of monopoly and the destructive nature of perfect competition.
<strong>Chapter 4: "The Ideology of Competition"</strong> shifts the
focus to the societal and psychological impact of competition.
Competition is not merely an economic concept but a deeply ingrained
"ideology" that pervades our society, from education to personal
aspirations. He reminds readers that this competition can blind people
to real opportunities and lead to irrational behavior and missed
chances, and suggests us to recognize and resist the pervasive ideology
of competition.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5 Last Mover Advantage</strong> discusses how a great
business is defined by its ability to generate future cash flows and
argues that being a last mover (i.e., to make the last great development
in a market and enjoy long-term monopoly profits) is more advantageous
than being a first mover. It outlines four characteristics of monopoly
that contribute to a company's durability:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Proprietary Technology:</strong> This makes a product
difficult to replicate, ideally being at least 10 times better than its
closest substitute (e.g., Google's search algorithms, PayPal's payment
system for eBay, Amazon's book selection, Apple's integrated
design).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Effects:</strong> The product becomes more
valuable as more people use it (e.g., Facebook). Thiel emphasizes that
such businesses must start with a very small, focused market to get
initial users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economies of Scale:</strong> Fixed costs can be spread
over increasing sales, making the business stronger as it grows.
Software companies are particularly suited for this due to near-zero
marginal costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Branding:</strong> A strong brand creates a monopoly
(e.g., Apple). However, branding needs to be built on substantive
advantages, not just surface-level polish.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"You've probably heard about 'first mover advantage': if you're the
first entrant into a market, you can capture significant market share
while competitors scramble to get started. But moving first is a tactic,
not a goal. What really matters is generating cash flows in the future,
so being the first mover doesn't do you any good if someone else comes
along and unseats you. It's much better to be the last mover— that is,
to make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years
or even decades of monopoly profits. The way to do that is to dominate a
small niche and scale up from there, toward your ambitious long-term
vision. In this one particular at least, business is like chess.
Grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca put it well: to succeed, 'you must
study the endgame before everything else.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thiel's advice for startups (1) start small and monopolize, 2) scale
up gradually, and 3) don't discrupt) reminds me of Google's AI strategy
in recent two years, which seems to align with the 'last mover
advantage' mentality. Instead of trying to release one massive,
all-encompassing AI that competes directly with established players
across every front, Google has released or integrated AI into many
"smaller" applications or features (workspace, photos, maps, gemini,
etc). Each of these can be seen as a "small market" or specific use case
where AI offers a distinct advantage, allowing Google to "monopolize"
that particular user experience. After establishing AI capabilities in
focused areas, they are integrating these more broadly. Successful AI
features in Workspace might then be leveraged for enterprise solutions.
Advancements in image recognition from Photos could be applied to
broader visual search or other AI models. The iterative development of
Bard/Gemini, starting as a conversational AI and gradually expanding its
capabilities (multimodality, coding, planning), is a clear example of
scaling up. They build upon established user bases and technological
strengths. While Google is certainly competing, their strategy doesn't
always seem to be about a direct, disruptive frontal assault that
immediately aims to destroy an incumbent. Instead, it's often about: 1)
leveraging their exsiting ecosystem, 2) focusing on unique capabilities,
3) creating new user behaviors.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chapter 6 You Are Not a Lottery Ticket</strong>, Thiel
described the concept of definite vs. indefinite futures and asserts
that the prevailing indefinite optimism, particularly in the US, is
unsustainable. He argues that real progress and success require definite
plans and individual effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When Baby Boomers grow up and write books to explain why one or
another individual is successful, they point to the power of a
particular individual's context as determined by chance. But they miss
the even bigger social context for their own preferred explanations: a
whole generation learned from childhood to overrate the power of chance
and underrate the importance of planning."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The core of <strong>Chapter 7 Follow the Money</strong> applies the
power law to venture capital (VC). Venture returns are not normally
distributed (where most companies perform average). Instead, they follow
a power law: a small handful of companies radically outperform all
others, often returning more than the entire rest of the fund combined.
People often fail to see the power law, which is a fundamental law of
the universe, because it only becomes clear over time; early-stage
companies in a portfolio might look similar before exponential growth
kicks in. Despite being a niche (less than 1% of new businesses receive
VC funding), venture-backed companies disproportionately drive the
economy, creating 11% of private sector jobs and generating 21% of GDP.
The largest tech companies, all venture-backed, are worth more than all
other tech companies combined.</p>
<p>Understanding the power law means focusing on the singular, most
important things (e.g., one best market, one dominant distribution
strategy). To achieve disproportionate success, one must identify and
focus relentlessly on those few critical elements.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chapter 8 Secrets</strong>, Thiel begins by posing his
contrarian question ("<em>What important truth do very few people agree
with you on?</em>") in the context of secrets. He states that a good
answer to this question implies the existence of secrets – something
important, unknown, difficult, but achievable. He argues that secrets
still exist and are crucial for progress.Secrets can lead to monumental
advancements in science, medicine, and technology (e.g., curing
diseases, new energy sources). In business, secrets can lead to valuable
companies built on overlooked opportunities, like Airbnb (untapped
supply and unaddressed demand in lodging) and Uber/Lyft (connecting
drivers and riders). In terms of how to find secrets, Thiel has
discussed about 1) secrets of nature from studying physical world, vs.
secrets about people from understanding human nature, 2) looking at the
fields that matter but haven't been standardized.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 9 Foundations</strong> is around 'Thiel's law': a
startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed, providing guidance
on fundamental level: co-founder relationships, ownership, possession,
and control, small boards, full time commitment, equity is the king,
founding moment, etc. <strong>Chapter 10 The Mechanics of Mafia</strong>
highlights the importance of company culture. <strong>Chapter 11 If You
Build It Will They Come</strong> stresses that distribution (sales,
marketing, advertising) is often underestimated and is just as crucial
as product development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The founding moment of a company, however, really does happen just
once: only at the very start do you have the opportunity to set the
rules that will align people toward the creation of value in the
future.</p>
<p>The most valuable kind of company maintains an openness to invention
that is most characteristic of beginnings. This leads to a second, less
obvious understanding of the founding: it lasts as long as a company is
creating new things, and it ends when creation stops. If you get the
founding moment right, you can do more than create a valuable company:
you can steer its distant future toward the creation of new things
instead of the stewardship of inherited success. You might even extend
its founding indefinitely."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"'Company culture' doesn't exist apart from the company itself: no
company has a culture; every company is a culture. A startup is a team
of people on a mission, and a good culture is just what that looks like
on the inside."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a core debate right now around whether AI is going to
replace human‘s jobs, and this book offers powerful arguments for the
"AI as complement, not replacement" side. Thiel explicitly argued
against the "substitution fallacy" in <strong>Chapter 12 (Man and
Machine)</strong>, stating that computers and humans have different
strengths and will thrive through collaboration. Although Generative AI
is unprecedented with its impact on human society nuanced to discuss, I
agree there are fundamental differences in intelligence between humans
and AI. Human possess intentionality, true innovation, empathy, and
emotional intelligence, and human judgment is needed when there are
ethical concerns or complex problems. AI as a tool can do augmentation
to increase productivity, but not automation. Historically speaking,
tech development always creates more jobs than destroyed. While some
roles are eliminated, new roles emerge: AI engineers, Prompt Engineers,
AI Product Managers, etc. In essence, it's about a redefinition of work,
rather than elimination.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"People compete for jobs and for resources; computers compete for
neither."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Globalization is about substitution. Technology is about
complementarity.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 13 Seeing Green</strong> analyzes the failure of the
cleantech bubble, attributing it to a widespread failure to answer the
seven critical questions every successful business must address.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Engineering Question:</strong> Most offered only
incremental, not breakthrough (10x better), technology (e.g., Solyndra's
inefficient cylindrical solar cells).</li>
<li><strong>The Timing Question:</strong> They misjudged market
readiness and the slow, linear progress of solar technology compared to
exponential tech.</li>
<li><strong>The Monopoly Question:</strong> They pursued
"trillion-dollar markets" that were fiercely competitive, rather than
small, defensible niches.</li>
<li><strong>The People Question:</strong> Teams were often led by
"salesman-executives" lacking technical expertise, focusing on
fundraising over product. (Thiel suggests a "never invest in a tech CEO
that wears a suit" rule.)</li>
<li><strong>The Distribution Question:</strong> Companies often
overlooked effective distribution, leading to complex and inconvenient
sales models (e.g., Better Place's battery swapping).</li>
<li><strong>The Durability Question:</strong> They failed to anticipate
competition (e.g., from China) or market shifts (e.g., the rise of
fracking).</li>
<li><strong>The Secret Question:</strong> They based their ventures on
"conventional truths" (the need for a cleaner world), which everyone
agreed on, rather than unique, hidden insights.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"The 1990s had one big idea: the internet is going to be big. But too
many internet companies had exactly that same idea and no others. An
entrepreneur can't benefit from macroscale insight unless his own plans
begin at the micro-scale. Cleantech companies faced the same problem: no
matter how much the world needs energy, only a firm that offers a
superior solution for a specific energy problem can make money. No
sector will ever be so important that merely participating in it will be
enough to build a great company."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Chapter 14 The Founder's Paradox</strong> explores the often
extreme, contradictory, and seemingly peculiar traits of successful
founders, arguing that these unique characteristics are both powerful
for a company and carry inherent dangers for the founder. Society needs
founders – unusual individuals who can make authoritative decisions,
inspire loyalty, and plan long-term, moving companies beyond
incrementalism. However, founders must be wary of overestimating their
own power and succumbing to their own myth, mistaking public adulation
or criticism for truth. The greatest danger for a founder is losing
their mind; for a business, it's losing its myth and vision.</p>
<p>The current AI boom feels very much like an "accelerating takeoff "
in terms of technological advancement, which is mentioned in the final
chapter "<strong>Conclusion: Stagnation or Singularity</strong>", as one
of the Nick Bostrom's four possible patterns for humanity's future.
Accelerating Takeoff (Singularity) is the most difficult scenario to
imagine: new technologies so powerful that they transcend current
understanding, leading to a much better future. Ray Kurzweil's
"Singularity is near" concept, based on exponential growth trends, is
mentioned as a prominent view of this outcome. However, as Thiel's book
is a manifesto for building a better future and criticizes 'indefinite
optimism', in the context of AI boom, 'Singularity' is not a
predetermined destination, but the choices we make today:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Are we using AI for "0 to 1" innovation to solve truly hard
problems and create new value, or are we just using it for "1 to n"
incremental improvements and fierce competition?</em></li>
<li><em>Are we making definite plans for how AI will integrate with and
enhance human capabilities, or are we succumbing to "indefinite fears"
or blind optimism?</em></li>
<li><em>Are we building companies around unique AI-driven insights that
can create sustainable monopolies, or are we simply entering crowded AI
markets hoping for a piece of an existing pie?</em></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The frontier isn’t volume—it’s discernment. And in that shift,
taste has become a survival skill.</em></p>
<p><em>Because when abundance is infinite, attention is everything. And
what you give your attention to—what you consume, what you engage with,
what you amplify—becomes a reflection of how you think.</em></p>
<p><em>What matters now is what you do with it. How you filter it. How
you recognize signal in the noise. Curation is the new IQ test.</em></p>
<p><em>Taste is often dismissed as something shallow or subjective. But
at its core, it’s a form of literacy—a way of reading the world. Good
taste isn’t about being right. It’s about being attuned. To rhythm, to
proportion, to vibe. It’s knowing when something is off, even if you
can’t fully articulate why.</em></p>
<p><em>Taste is what allows you to skim past the performative noise, the
fake depth, the viral bait, and know—instinctively—what’s worth your
time.</em></p>
<p><em>And that’s what real taste is: a deep internal coherence. A way
of filtering the world through intuition that’s been sharpened by
attention.</em></p>
<p><em>When you sharpen your discernment, you stop being swayed by
trends. You stop needing consensus. You stop reacting to every new thing
like it’s urgent.</em></p>
<p><em>There will always be creators. But the ones who stand out in this
era are also curators. People who filter their worldview so cleanly that
you want to see through their eyes. People who make you feel sharper
just by paying attention to what they pay attention to.</em></p>
<p><em>1995 interview with Steve Jobs — <strong>“Ultimately, it comes
down to taste. It comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best
things that humans have done, and then try to bring those things into
what you’re doing.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Good taste isn’t restrictive. It’s expansive. It allows you to
contain multitudes without becoming incongruent.</em></p>
<p><em>But good taste is deep structure. It’s the throughline in
someone’s life. You can see it in the design of their home, the cadence
of their speech, the way they treat people, the books on their
shelves.</em> <em>Taste is how you live a congruent life. Not in the
sense of brand consistency, but in the sense of spiritual alignment. You
can change your mind. Explore new spaces. But your values stay intact.
Your center holds.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is an amazing article. In an age of infinite content, taste is
your compass. It’s not about elitism—it’s about aligning your attention
with what truly matters to you. We can do these:</p>
<p><strong>Learnings and Suggestions</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Cultivate Discernment Over Consumption: Prioritize depth over
volume in what you read, watch, and engage with. Ask "Is this worth my
time?" before consuming content, creating something, or sharing. Trust
your intuition—if something feels off, skip it.</p></li>
<li><p>Curate Your Inputs (Because They Shape Your Outputs): Unfollow
accounts, mute topics, and unsubscribe from newsletters that don’t align
with your values. Follow thinkers, creators, and curators who
consistently offer depth. Set boundaries (e.g., no mindless scrolling
after 9 PM). Pause after reading/watching to digest, not just
react.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a "Library Mindset" (Not a Wishlist One): Read books,
essays, and long-form work that lingers. Don’t engage with viral content
just because it’s popular. Save/share only what resonates deeply—not
what’s merely entertaining.</p></li>
<li><p>Train Your Taste Like a Muscle: Study great art, writing, music,
and design to refine your sensibility. Remove distractions, unnecessary
commitments, and low-value inputs. Note what ideas/images/sounds stay
with you—these reveal your true taste.</p></li>
<li><p>Embrace Coherence Over Consistency: Your bookshelf, playlists,
and feeds should reflect who you are (or aspire to be). Stay open to new
influences, but filter them through your core principles. Don’t adopt
aesthetics/opinions for status—authenticity matters more.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice "Vibe Coding" (Like Rick Rubin): Whether in
conversations or creativity, prioritize feeling over formulas. In
work/life, strip away excess until only the essential remains. If
something feels "alive," lean in—even if it defies logic.</p></li>
<li><p>Reject Cheap Dopamine for Lasting Satisfaction: Opt for the book
over the tweet, the slow movie over the clip. After consuming something,
ask: Did this uplift or drain me? Regularly eliminate distractions
(apps, subscriptions, habits) that don’t serve you.</p></li>
<li><p>Taste as a Spiritual Practice: Prioritize art/ideas that
rearrange your perspective. From your home to your workspace, align
space with intention. Engage only with what nourishes, not
depletes.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember: Curation = Power: Amplify only what deserves a wider
audience. Your ability to filter signal from noise is a competitive
edge. The more you refine your taste, the more it protects you from
chaos.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Concepts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction Costs</strong>: Costs incurred in addition to
the actual price of a good or service, necessary to coordinate and
execute a transaction. Marketplaces primarily sell the reduction of
these costs.</li>
<li><strong>TAM Expansion</strong>: Reducing transaction costs lowers
the effective cost of a good or service, increasing demand and expanding
the Total Addressable Market (TAM). The degree of TAM expansion relates
to the percentage of total cost eliminated.</li>
<li><strong>Value Distribution:</strong> Marketplaces save sellers money
on transaction costs and charge them a fee (often similar to what
sellers paid previously). They typically pass efficiency gains on to
buyers in the form of easier and faster experiences, creating a
demand-constrained market. <strong>Variable Costs of Addressing
Transaction Costs:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Variable Costs:</strong> Addressing search and
bargaining costs is highly efficient and has low variable costs.
Marketplaces can keep more of the value created here.</li>
<li><strong>High Variable Costs:</strong> Addressing enforcement and
distribution costs involves significant variable costs (e.g., funding
returns, building logistics). While these make marketplaces bigger,
margins may be lower as value is passed to buyers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong>:</p>
<p>This article puts the concept of transaction costs as central to
understanding marketplaces. Transaction costs are defined as the costs
incurred beyond the actual price of a good or service, associated with
coordinating and executing the transaction itself. Marketplaces are
essentially businesses that sell the reduction of these transaction
costs. Studying transaction costs can help determine where marketplaces
will succeed, what kind of marketplaces to build, and how to price
them.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the article suggests that the "free lunch"
opportunities in many industries are exhausted, pushing marketplaces
into high variable cost activities. This implies future marketplaces may
be higher scale but potentially lower margin and more operationally
intensive. To disrupt incumbent marketplaces, one should look for
remaining transaction costs that can be addressed much more efficiently
than the current solution. The article suggests disrupting food delivery
was possible by building a more efficient network than restaurants had,
but disrupting shipping for handmade goods is harder because it requires
competing with highly efficient companies like UPS and Fedex.</p>
<p>By far, the largest unsolved transaction costs are in the
<strong>services industries</strong> (e.g., freelancing, home
improvement), which constitute two-thirds of consumer spending. Most
services marketplaces are currently stuck at the Lead Generation stage,
limiting penetration and take rate. This might be partly because much
spend is on recurring services where customers leave the marketplace
once a good provider is found, leading services marketplaces to rely on
high-churn consumer subscriptions. Despite this, there are
opportunities, such as Zillow exploring expanding into managed
marketplace territory for home services.</p>

<p>The one hour is suggested to be dedicated to three key practices that
aim to rebuild an individual from the ground up:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Build Something That's Yours</strong>: This involves
creating something that belongs to you, beyond your job, such as a
newsletter, product, service, blog, or by learning/teaching a skill. The
purpose is to "plant seeds" that will compound over time, pulling you
out of stagnation.</li>
<li><strong>Train Like You Want to Be Here for a While</strong>: This
practice emphasizes physical strength and movement, like walking,
running, stretching, lifting, breathing, sleeping deeply, eating real
food, and drinking water. It's a message of self-care and an intention
to use one's body, which also sharpens mental clarity, as Seneca
suggested, "The body should be treated more rigorously, that it may not
be disobedient to the mind".</li>
<li><strong>Create Enough Silence to Hear Your Own Voice</strong>: This
habit counters the constant noise and stimulation of modern life. It
encourages practices like journaling, meditating, taking walks without
headphones, or simply sitting still without a goal or screen. The goal
is not productivity, but presence and creating space for reflection and
insight, preventing thoughts from being drowned out and actions from
remaining unexamined.</li>

Fool</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aprilandthefool.substack.com/p/how-to-become-friends-with-literally">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article suggests that becoming friends with anyone is to approach
interactions with a deep-seated belief in shared humanity, genuine
curiosity about individual worldviews, and an open, empathetic demeanor
that seeks to understand rather than judge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Try to understand people through conversations with a belief
in the universal commonality of human nature:</strong> The author
fundamentally believes that all people are driven by the same core human
urges and desires, such as the need to feel loved, respected, and seen.
This perspective makes it intuitive to understand others. They see
meeting someone new as a "puzzle of empathy" and a "game of
commonality," where they try to understand what someone would think,
want, need, or crave given their background, values, limitations, and
longings.</li>
<li><strong>From common nature to differences among people due to
environmental factors:</strong> The author acknowledges that
<em>how</em> these needs are defined and achieved varies dramatically
due to factors like nationality, gender, religion, cultural heritage,
socioeconomic class, hobbies, and upbringing. These "little big
differences" are where things become interesting, leading to unique
individual personalities and perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Follow the reasonableness within their personal worldview to
understand motivations and values:</strong> The author believes that
while people may not always be rational, they are always "reasonable"
within their own worldview. This means that everyone has reasons for
their actions, and those reasons make sense within their personal
framework. Understanding a person's circumstances allows the author to
understand their motivations, struggles, and values.</li>
<li><strong>Be curious and genuine while engaging with people:</strong>
The author describes themselves as extremely extraverted, loving people,
and hating small talk. They are curious about people, viewing them as
containing "worlds, histories, stories that span across generations and
geographies". This curiosity leads them to give "rapt attention and
genuine space to be yourself".</li>
<li><strong>Assumption of friendship from the beginning, share stories
and genuine care:</strong> The author approaches new encounters with the
assumption that "we are friends" from the moment they meet. They are
open, putting "all my cards on the table" and inviting others to reveal
theirs. They enjoy conversations, making people feel understood, heard,
and cared for.</li>
</ul>

economic value, rather than promising to "transform
everything."</em></p>
<p><em>Systemantics, or, the art of understanding what’s going on, means

</blockquote>
<p>the article suggests that thinking like a genius involves adopting a
holistic and nuanced approach to problems by utilizing the AQAL model,
encompassing all relevant perspectives (quadrants) and evolving one's
consciousness to a "second-tier" level that can integrate and synthesize
different stages of understanding. This allows for faster
problem-solving and greater achievement in life.</p>
<p><strong>All Quadrants</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual Interior (Upper Left): Your personal thoughts, emotions,
beliefs, and consciousness. Questions in this quadrant might include
core values, what makes you feel alive, or fears holding you back.</li>
<li>Individual Exterior (Upper Right): Your behaviors, actions, and
physical brain states. This involves looking at natural talents,
developed skills, and what your behavior reveals about your
preferences.</li>
<li>Collective Interior (Lower Left): Shared culture, values, and group
consciousness. This could involve understanding parental or religious
expectations, influence of friends, or shared values you're drawn
to.</li>
<li>Collective Exterior (Lower Right): Systems, structures, and social
institutions. This quadrant considers current job opportunities, the
impact of education or technology, and systemic barriers or
advantages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All Levels</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Premodern: Characterized by following established authority and
traditions, with black-and-white thinking and obedience to a God or
conformity.</p></li>
<li><p>Modern: Values science, individual achievement, competition, and
merit-based success.</p></li>
<li><p>Postmodern: Emphasizes relativistic thinking, where everyone's
truth is valid, and focuses on inclusion and equality. The article notes
that postmodern thinking can become pathological when it attempts to
dismantle all hierarchies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Second-Tier</strong>: This is the suggested stage for
"genius" thinkers. Individuals at this level can look back and
synthesize truths from all prior perspectives, embracing complexity,
systems thinking, and awareness. It's less about "I'm right and you're
wrong" and more about <strong>finding the best solution through
synthesis, holding contradictions in mind until they can be
reconciled</strong>. <strong>Genius thinkers act as "translators"
between different stages</strong>.</p></li>

Data</strong> [<a

</blockquote>
<p>A summary of the four junior traits and what to do instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Junior Trait #1: Providing too much
detail/over-explaining</strong>
<ul>
<li>Excessive detail doesn't showcase knowledge and consideration of
edge cases, but it typically confuses the audience and makes them appear
unable to synthesize information, causing key points to be missed.
Managers may even prevent such individuals from presenting to executives
to avoid confusion and inefficiency in meetings.</li>
<li>What to do about it:
<ul>
<li>In written form: Summarize work with a "TL;DR" at the top, using the
Pyramid Principle (conclusion first, then supporting evidence). Focus on
what is important enough to communicate, moving less critical details to
an appendix.</li>
<li>In verbal form: Practice an "elevator pitch" of less than 30 seconds
to peers, focusing on the "why" and enough "what" to allow for opinion
formation. <strong>The ability to decide what NOT to communicate is as
crucial as what to mention.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Junior Trait #2: Not having an opinion or
recommendation</strong>
<ul>
<li>As data scientists become more senior, translating analysis into a
recommendation becomes increasingly important. Hesitation to provide
recommendations often stems from the perceived risk and the nuanced,
non-black-and-white nature of data, leading to "analysis paralysis".
However, not giving recommendations shows a lack of ownership and limits
one to simple "execution" work.</li>
<li>What to do about it:
<ul>
<li>Adopt an <strong>ownership mindset</strong>, imagining you are the
decision-maker. Ask what data <em>you</em> would need and if the
presented data would convince <em>you</em>.</li>
<li>Understand that value comes from giving robust recommendations
<em>despite</em> nuance and ambiguity, just as taking risks can lead to
above-average returns.</li>
<li>While you should list caveats, <strong>most people prefer a
recommendation they disagree with over no recommendation at all, as it
provides a basis for discussion and understanding assumptions.</strong>
Data teams are paid to <strong>drive business decisions,</strong> not
just pull and present data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Junior Trait #3: Not being clear about the "why" behind the
analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li>Junior DS often state "XYZ stakeholder asked for this" as the sole
reason for an analysis, which is insufficient. This indicates a lack of
ownership of the business problem and hinders the ability to deliver
effective solutions, leading to frustration from changing data
requests.</li>
<li>What to do about it:
<ul>
<li><strong>Own the problem</strong>. When asked to pull data, find out
<em>why</em> the stakeholder needs it and what decision they are trying
to make.</li>
<li>By understanding the ultimate business problem, you can
<strong>brainstorm the most effective data solutions</strong>,
potentially different from the original request, thus <strong>elevating
yourself to a</strong> <strong>thought partner</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Junior Trait #4: Not having the basics down to be able to
stay "one step ahead"</strong>
<ul>
<li>Losing credibility happens when people feel you don't know the data
or business area you cover. To establish yourself as an expert, you need
to <strong>anticipate common questions and be the most familiar with the
data in your area</strong>. If you lack answers to natural follow-up
questions, it suggests you haven't thoroughly understood or explored the
data.</li>
<li>What to do about it:
<ul>
<li>Be curious about your data; start with a basic question and explore
from there, jotting down answers.</li>
<li>Anticipate follow-up questions in three buckets before presenting:
<strong>foundational knowledge</strong> (e.g., how the product works,
user numbers), <strong>your analysis</strong> (details beyond the main
insights), and <strong>next steps</strong> (what the findings mean for
stakeholders).</li>
<li>Get a second pair of eyes on your work, ideally from someone not
deep in the analysis, to catch obvious omissions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve reasoning via extended thinking
(e.g., multi-step traces), but this leads to inefficiencies like
overthinking simple queries, increasing latency and token usage. The
team Introduces Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models (LHRMs) — the first models
that adaptively choose when to think based on query complexity,
balancing performance and efficiency. They utilizes a two-stage
approach: 1) <strong>Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT)</strong> – cold start
using curated datasets labeled as "think" vs. "non-think"; 2)
<strong>Hybrid Group Policy Optimization (HGPO)</strong> – an online RL
method that trains the model to pick the optimal reasoning mode. They
defines <strong>Hybrid Accuracy</strong> to evaluate how well the model
selects between thinking and non-thinking strategies; correlates
strongly with human judgment. Experiments show LHRMs outperform both
LRMs and traditional LLMs in reasoning accuracy and response quality,
while also reducing unnecessary computation.</p>

<p><strong>How much do language models memorize? - Meta, Google, NVIDIA,
and Cornell University</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24832">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper proposed a new method to quantify how much information a
language model "knows" about a datapoint.</p>
<p>They formally separate memorization into two components by two novel
definitions of memorization: unintended memorization (information about
a specific dataset) and generalization (information about the true
data-generation process).</p>
<p><strong>There are several interesting findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By training models on uniform random bitstrings (eliminating
generalization), they precisely measure model capacity, finding
GPT-style transformers store 3.5 to 4 bits per parameter.</li>
<li>Their framework shows that the double descent phenomenon occurs when
the data size exceeds the model capacity, suggesting that models are
"forced" to generalize when they can no longer individually memorize
datapoints.</li>
<li>The paper develops and validates a scaling law that predicts
membership inference performance based on model capacity and dataset
size, indicating that membership inference becomes harder with larger
datasets relative to model capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To understand their smart methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>They proposed a very clever approach to understand memorization
and model capacity in LM. They isolate unintended memorization by
training models on <strong>uniform random bitstrings</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>No Generalization Signal: When training on truly random data, there
are no underlying patterns, rules, or structures for the model to
generalize from. Each bitstring is an independent, random piece of
information.</li>
<li>Only Memorization is Possible: In this scenario, the <em>only</em>
way for the model to "learn" or perform well on this data (i.e., predict
the next bit in a sequence or identify if it was part of the training
set) is to literally memorize the specific bitstrings it has seen. Any
"knowledge" the model gains is purely about the individual data
points.</li>
<li>Total Memorization as Measured: Therefore, when generalization is
effectively zero, the information the model stores about the random
bitstrings directly reflects its <em>total memorization capacity</em>
for that type of information. There's no "general knowledge" to
distinguish; it's all about remembering specific instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, they are measuring the maximum amount of distinct,
specific information the model can store.</p>
<p>They equal total memorization to model capacity. In machine learning,
model capacity generally refers to the <strong>size and complexity of
the functions a model is capable of learning</strong>. It's the model's
ability to fit a wide variety of patterns in the data. A model with
higher capacity can potentially fit more complex relationships or
memorize more specific data points.</p>
<p>The paper further quantifies this by showing that GPT-style models
have a capacity of approximately 3.6 bits-per-parameter. This indicates
that each parameter in the model effectively acts as a certain amount of
storage for information, reflecting the overall capacity of the neural
network architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>The fundamental challenge in understanding and evaluating
language models is the <strong>ambiguity and conflation of
"memorization" (copy or reproduce a specific sequence in the training
data) and "learning." (truly understand and generalize a pattern or
concept)</strong> This is exactly what they addressed by decomposing
memorization into unintended memorization and generalization. The
decomposition enables controlled measurement and the use of random
bitstrings is the key innovation.</p>
<p>About the Double Descent Phenomena: When a model's capacity exceeds
the generalizable patterns in the data, it starts to memorize individual
data points. As data size increases relative to capacity, the model is
"forced" to generalize more, leading to a decrease in unintended
memorization and an improvement in performance.</p>
<p>The core insight is that as models become massively overparameterized
(far beyond what's needed to simply fit the training data), they find
"simpler" interpolating solutions that generalize better, often due to
the implicit biases of optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD).</p>
<p><strong>Intuition for double descent</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>"Under-parameterized" Regime (Classical ML): Model Capacity &lt;
Data Size: very generalizable, low test error</li>
<li>"Interpolation Threshold" (The Peak): Model Capacity ~ Data Size:
peak of test error, due to overfitting the noise</li>
<li>"Over-parameterized" Regime (Double Descent / Modern Deep Learning):
Model Capacity &gt;&gt; Data Size: robust generalization happens, test
error goes down again.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Here is a concept <strong>Membership Inference Attacks
(MIAs):</strong> These are attacks that attempt to determine whether a
specific data point was part of a model's training dataset or not. A
successful MIA indicates that the model has "memorized" that specific
data point. "Scaling Laws for Membership Inference" in the paper refers
to <strong>predictive relationships that describe how the success rate
of a MIA changes as a function of various model and data
characteristics</strong>, such as model capacity and dataset size.</p>
<p>They basically propose that <strong>membership inference success is
inversely related to how "generalizable" the data point is within the
model's capacity.</strong> In other words, membership inference is
<strong>easier</strong> when the model has high capacity relative to the
dataset size, leading to more unintended memorization of individual data
points. Membership inference becomes <strong>harder</strong> (i.e., less
successful for an attacker) when the dataset size is very large compared
to the model's capacity, or when the model starts to "grok" (generalize)
more.</p></li>

Anthropic</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/reasoning-models-dont-say-think">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The core issue explored is whether the Chain-of-Thought accurately
reflects the model's true reasoning process ("faithfulness"). The
article's research suggests that models frequently do not faithfully
report their reasoning. Researchers tested this by subtly providing
hints (both correct and incorrect) to models during evaluations. They
then checked if the models admitted using these hints in their
Chain-of-Thought explanations. The results showed that models (Claude
3.7 Sonnet and DeepSeek R1) rarely mentioned the hints they used, even
when those hints led them to a different answer or involved potentially
problematic information (like "unauthorized access"). Instead, models
often created fake rationales for their answers.</p>
<p>The researchers also studied reward hacking by constructing synthetic
Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments with injected "reward hacks."
They then finetuned an earlier snapshot of Claude 3.7 Sonnet in these
environments using outcome-based RL. By setting up the environments this
way, they could observe if the models learned to pick the incorrect hint
answer to maximize their reward, and then check if their
Chain-of-Thought verbalized this reward-seeking behavior. They found
that models learned the reward hacks very quickly (selecting the
incorrect hint answer over 99% of the time), but rarely verbalized these
hacks in their Chain-of-Thought (less than 2% of examples in most
environments).</p>

<p>This report examines the potential for AI to cause human extinction.
The authors analyzed three specific scenarios: <strong>the use of
weapons, the release of biological pathogens, and severe climate warming
via malicious geoengineering</strong>. The study concludes that
significant barriers exist for AI to achieve human extinction and it
would likely require intentional AI action and substantial time for the
threats to materialize, allowing for human response and mitigation
efforts. Ultimately, the report suggests that resources dedicated to AI
extinction risk should also support broader global catastrophic risk
mitigation and general AI safety.</p>
<p>This analysis starts from what could cause human extinction and
assesses how AI could contribute to that. The threats are limited to
those can be explored through scenario planning, while those that
involve a deeper level of uncertainty are ignored.</p>

<p><strong>Agentic Misalignment: How LLMs could be insider threats -
Anthropic</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researchers stress-tested 16 leading AI models from various
developers and found that in certain situations, these models resorted
to malicious behaviors like blackmailing officials or leaking sensitive
information. These actions occurred when the models faced replacement or
when their assigned goals conflicted with the company's changing
direction, even when they were given only harmless business goals and
explicitly told to avoid such behaviors. While no evidence of agentic
misalignment has been observed in real deployments, the findings suggest
caution when deploying current models in roles with minimal human
oversight and access to sensitive information.</p>

<p><em>I think being smart — and not being afraid to show it — means
living with discomfort. It's difficult. It means being willing and able
to admit when you're wrong. And it means being okay with complexity,
contradiction, and uncertainty.</em></p>
<p><em>So, the good news: I think smart survives. It's stubborn. It's
not loud. It's not flashy. But it's resilient — like a cockroach with a
PhD.</em></p>
<p><em>And the thing about stupidity is that eventually it bumps into
the hard wall of reality. When the bridges collapse and the crops fail,
when the Amazon package doesn't show up because the supply chain finally
imploded — suddenly people start looking around and going, "Hey, does
anybody know how to fix things? Build things?"</em></p>
<p><em>And the guy who spent the last 20 years reading books and
educating himself instead of screaming at his phone? Yeah, he's the one
holding the duct tape.</em></p>
<p><em>It won't be sexy, and it won't be immediate. But intelligence
isn't dead — it's just hungover. And sooner or later, we're going to
need it to crawl out of bed, drink some black coffee, and start fixing
the mess.</em></p>
<p><em>So at the end of the day, stupidity will always be popular — at
least in the U.S. But intelligence — real, patient, compassionate
intelligence — is what keeps the lights on.</em></p>
<p><em>And by the way, that goes for emotional intelligence too, which
is every bit as important.</em></p>
<p><em>So if you're still here, still critically thinking, still
refusing to go quietly into that great dumb night — you're already part
of the resistance.</em></p>
<p><em>Keep going.</em></p>

<p>The iPhone maker has launched the Foundation Models framework to
allow users to run a 3B parameter model locally. The framework is part
of Apple Intelligence suite and allows developers to access it using
three lines of code. The model can be used to generate text, extract
summaries, and tag structured information from unstructured text.</p>
<p>Users should be aware of strength and weakness. It's only available
on Apple Intelligence-enabled devices with OS version 26+. You need to
use Xcode Playgrounds to prototype with real model output. You can use
Instruments profiling template to measure latency and token overhead.
There is no support for fine-tuning or external model deployment</p>

<p>"<strong><em>How Leaders Learn</em></strong>" by <strong>David
Novak</strong> is a great book for active learners. It has three
chapters: "Learn from", "Learn to", and "Learn by".</p>
<p>Active learners are like artists—constantly refining, adapting, and
evolving. They approach life as an masterpiece-in-progress,
understanding that each new insight adds depth and clarity to the bigger
picture. The book encourages active learning and defines it as a mindset
- a daily discipline of seeking out knowledge from people, experience,
and failures, staying open to feedback, new perspectives, and
uncomfortable truths, and taking actions to test ideas, adapting and
refining.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An active learner is somebody who seeks out ideas and insights and
then pairs them with action and execution. They learn with purpose. The
result is greater possibilities-for them and the people around them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It's as Eric Hoffer, the American philosopher, wrote in Reflections
on the Human Condition: "In a time of drastic change, it is the learners
who inherit the future." They can't wait to discover the next idea, and
the next, and the next, because behind every idea is a world of
possibility and a brighter future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Warren Buffett once told me what he looks for in the companies he
acquires. He said, "I'm looking to buy companies that are run by
painters." When I asked for an explanation, he said, "Most great artists
have a hard time letting go of their paintings. They're in love with the
painting. They are constantly adding a dab of color here, a little more
texture there. I'm looking for the boss who is always tweaking their
company, constantly trying to make it better. No matter how successful
they may have already been, what they still see is a
masterpiece-in-progress." He calls Berkshire Hathaway a museum for these
masterpieces, but he expects the people who run them to keep making
progress, to keep changing and expanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This book covers a lot of good practices, some of which I learned
through experience and have been implementing in daily life, but I've
never clearly summarized them in words like this author does (e.g.,
learn from failure and success, learn to ask better questions, learn to
develop pattern thinking, learn to reflect, learn by tackling problems,
etc); some are common sense to people but not easy to follow (e.g. learn
to see the world the way it really is, learn to make and check your own
judgments, learn by being your best self, learn by seeking new
challenges, learn by making everyone count, learn by recognizing on
purpose, etc); others are new ideas and wise advice to me that are
incredibly enlightening (e.g., learn from new environment, learn to
trust in positive intentions, learn to be humble and confident, learn by
simplying, learn by teaching, etc).</p>
<p>My Learnings:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I carry good values and get rid of bad values from my upbringings
and move on, but never go back and think about weakness and blind spots
that were developed implictly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our upbringings shape us-the good and bad experiences, the normal
experiences of our day-to-day lives. When you choose to learn from your
upbringing, you learn who you are, your strengths and weaknesses, your
unique perspective, and your blind spots.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>I'm the type of person who stick to one thing or one job, do the
best, and get the most learnings from it - greedy but probably not the
most efficient approach. So this is the top one advice for me:
<strong><em>"Not moving means not growing"</em></strong> and
<strong><em>"Choose environment wisely and don't stand
still"</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New environments bring uncertainty and risk, two things humans really
don't like. The brain weighs threats of loss heavier than it does
opportunities for gain. Whether it's a move to a new city or a move to a
new company, we don't know the people or the culture and we don't know
if we'll succeed when we get there. The brain tells us it's best if we
just stay where we are, in our more certain, less risky, known
environment. But that's not always the right choice. Josh Waitzkin,
child chess prodigy, subject of the book and movie Searching for Bobby
Fischer, and later a tai chi world champion, wrote in The Art of
Learning, "Growth comes at the expense of previous comfort or
safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, not every new environment is good for you, it requires some
luck and judgment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When looking at a new environment, evaluate it for these four sources
of learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>New knowledge, skills, or systems</li>
<li>New ideas and innovative thinking</li>
<li>New people and their perspectives and opinions</li>
<li>New influences that lead to personal growth</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some new environments aren't going to advance your learning; they
might even slow you down.</p>
<p>First, make sure the new environment will offer opportunities to
learn and grow in any area that's important to you right now, like I
did. This is especially true when you have an ambition but aren't sure
how to get there.</p>
<p>As important as this work is, the next important step is to insert
ourselves in an environment filled with people who routinely do what
we're struggling to imagine." This is the whole point of choosing a new
environment.</p>
<p>Second, choose an environment that's suited to you. Understanding
your personal ideal environment is an important aspect of
self-awareness.</p>
<p>Third, choose an environment that will exert the right influences on
you, so that you're not only learning new skills, new knowledge, and new
ideas, but also absorbing better collaboration, better leadership,
better self-management, or whatever area of personal growth you think
you need to work on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not only about growth, new environment can shape a person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our social and cultural environments have a huge impact on our
thinking and behavior. In Infuencer, psychologist Joseph Grenny and his
coauthors explain that if you want to change behavior, you have to make
changes to the social and structural environment. In Atomic Habits,
James Clear argues that our environments usually matter more than our
motivation when it comes to building new habits: "Especially over a long
time period, your personal characteristics tend to get overpowered by
your environment."</p>
<p>You can either fight that truth or leverage it to learn more and grow
more. Eric Gleacher recognized the power of environment and how it could
not only offer new skills but also shape the person he would become at a
surprisingly young age.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Have a look at what a getting-things-done talent looks like and
fill the gap. Although people all succeed in different ways and no one's
success is replicable, becoming a 'working genius' is at least a good
option to start.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Invention: creating novel ideas or solutions</p>
<p>Discernment: evaluating and analyzing ideas and situations</p>
<p>Galvanizing: organizing and inspiring others to take action</p>
<p>Enablement: providing encouragement and assistance</p>
<p>Tenacity: pushing projects to completion</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're wondering who you should turn to, always start with people
who have applied their ideas in the real world and can prove that they
work.</p>
<p>Next, ask, Will they actually fill my gaps, or will they hold back
their best ideas or try to elevate their ego by making what they know
seem complex and hard to understand? Will they make their knowledge
simple and clear? Essentially, you're asking, Is this person an active
learner? Because active learners love helping people fill their
gaps.</p>
<p>A final tip: if you want people to share their know-how with you, you
need to spread know-how. You need to be willing to share with them,
too.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Human has instinct to avoid social pain or negative truth about
themselves, when someone tells a less positive truth, we need to fight
our instincts and always listen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When somebody cares enough and is brave enough to tell you the truth,
your best course of action is to fight your instincts to dismiss it or
hide from it. Overcome your brain's biological drive to protect you.
Shut down the voice in your head telling you they're wrong. Don't run
out of the room. Take some deep calming breaths (that really works),
remind yourself that this person probably has a good reason for bringing
the truth to your attention, and listen.</p>
<p>Active learners work through this set of mental gymnastics every day.
They work on their humility and maintaining an open mind (more on this
in part two because they see the value truth-tellers bring.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Pursue the truth of the world, don't be delusional. Although
'<em>we see the world as we are, not as it is' (</em>Adaptation of Anaïs
Nin's famous quote), we at least should be aware of this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andy Pearson: "Learn to see the world the way it really is, not how
you wish it to be."</p>
<p>Darrow: "Chase after the truth like all hell and you'll free
yourself, even though you never touch its coat tails."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In their book Decisive, Chip Heath and Dan Heath explained that a
sound decision-making process is more important than data and analysis,
because no matter what, that data or our analysis of it is often flawed.
We interpret it based on what we wish or what we assume or what we
think, not what is.</p>
<p>Good process can lead to better analysis, they explained, but
analysis without good process won't produce the best learning. You need
both to orient yourself to reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you see the world the way it really is, the right action becomes
very clear.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to be a better critical thinker is to make sure
that your information is as close to the source as possible. If you
don't go to the source yourself, you might be letting one perception
after another influence what you end up hearing or learning. You won't
know if you're seeing reality.</p>
<p>When you're trying to see the world the way it really is, it's
important to not be blinded by good news, something a good process can
help you overcome.</p>
<p>A great way to stay grounded is to not only chase the truth but also
deal in it. Active learners know the value of being honest and
transparent. They tell it like it is, because they know when they do,
there's a greater chance others will, too.</p>

<li><p>I love pattern thinking and I seek out actively, but I still
limit myself by a passive pursue of richer life experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To prepare to make that leap, active learners expose themselves to as
many patterns from as many disciplines as they can. Being curious about
the world around us in the hope that we'll discover a new way of
thinking about a problem or a new way of seeing an opportunity is core
to active learning. Active learners read, listen, travel, try new
things, explore hobbies and interests. They explore trends and insights
from different disciplines, industries, cultures. Then they apply what
they've absorbed to problems or goals. Those habits have helped me come
up with some of my most successful ideas.</p>
<p>You might think of a pattern-thinking moment as an aha moment or a
stroke of inspiration, but active learners don't wait for the moment to
hit them; they work to find it.</p>
<p>Peter Georgescu, chairman emeritus of advertising giant Young &amp;
Rubicam and author of The Source of Success, said of pattern thinking,
"A creative solution is a leap, and that leap is supported and fed and
nurtured by experiences in life. The richer your life experience is, the
more creative you'll become."</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>About reflection and thinking, the book elaborates two modes:
focus mode and diffese mode. It resonates with me as I do see the
benefits of switching between data science work during the day time and
freestyle dancing in the evening in terms of developing creative ideas
and unstuck myself from difficult problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In her talk, she described two modes of thinking: focus mode and
diffuse mode. Focus mode is exactly what it sounds like. It's how we
think when we're trying to accomplish a task or memorize something. Our
thinking is usually confined to neural paths we've already created.
Diffuse mode is a more "relaxed set of neural states" that allows our
thinking to take off, range widely, and process or even create new
ideas. When we are learning, we need both. And when we feel stuck in our
thinking, unable to understand a concept, unable to unravel a challenge,
we especially need the diffuse mode.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>A combination of confidence and humility is a good
characteristic. I've never thought about them deeply as a combo, that's
why I've never found the sweet spot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Confidence is important because nobody will follow you unless they
believe you know where you're going and you'll find a way to get there.
If that confidence isn't tempered by humility, though, it becomes
arrogance.</p>
<p>Humility is just the recognition that you can't do it by yourself
whatever "it" is-either because you simply can't, because you don't know
enough, or because it won't be as fun or fulfilling if you go it
alone.</p>
<p>Confidence is simply the expectation that you'll find a way to
win-somehow.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>People have good side and bad side. If you believe in their good
side, they do so. From another perspective, it's often not their fault
if they choose to express the bad side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In any relationship, business or personal, somebody has to trust more
or trust first to break inertia and build up positive momentum.</p>
<p>As important as it is for us to trust in positive intentions, if we
want people to trust in ours, we need to behave accordingly. We need to
build a well of trust to draw on.</p>
<p>We're all human; we're all going to lose our tempers or handle a
delicate situation poorly or not show as much compassion as we should or
make a poor judgment call. When we're on the receiving end, if we can
take a breath, find a little empathy, and trust that the other person
has good intentions that didn't pan out, we can avoid a total breakdown
in the flow of ideas and learning and collaboration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I read a striking definition of trust recently: "Trust is a
relationship of reliance." Aren't we all reliant on each other if we
want to learn, grow, and expand our possibilities? We can choose to
support that relationship or tear it down. If we choose the second
option, we're only limiting ourselves. If we choose the first, the
possibilities are infinite.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>This is from my experience: I only think hard, struggle and
learn, when I'm dealing with my own unique life path, I don't take time
to think when I follow other's path or live to other's expectation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may know the quote often attributed to Oscar Wilde: "Be yourself;
everyone else is taken." (What he actually wrote is more cynical: "Most
people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions,
their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation." Maybe because of my
background and the potential prejudgments that came with it, I've spent
most of my life working hard to just be me to understand who that person
is, the contributions I have to offer, what I believe, and my purpose
and passions. If I hadn't followed this path, I would have missed out on
so much learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Active learners know that it's hard to learn when your mental energy
is focused on trying to be somebody other than yourself. Instead of
being open and curious, you'll be defensive. You'll be putting up
barriers and withholding your brilliance. And then the people around you
will do the same. Most of us can sense when people aren't being
authentic, and it makes us trust them less.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Active learners like Marvin pursue authenticity by recognizing their
unique value and talents, figuring out what matters to them and why, and
then leveraging it to have a positive impact.</p>
<p>It's all about bringing who you are to the moment so that you're
comfortable and open-minded enough to learn important lessons and ideas
as they arise.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Everyone knows we need do the right things, but when it comes
difficult situations, would you like to prioritize it above all
else?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is vital, because over time, depending on environments and
circumstances and your own choices, your sense of right and wrong can
suffer from stepwise degradation. You stray over the line, stray a bit
further the next time, justifying one bad action after another. Stray
too far over the line and you can lose sight of it entirely. Eventually,
you lose the ability to know what doing the right thing looks like.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The best thing that happens when we do the right thing is that we
feel good about our choices and the impact we're having on the world,
and that inspires us to keep doing the right thing. Values aren't some
thing you write down on a piece of paper and then put in a drawer or
hang on the wall. Values are something you use to take good action. It
isn't always the easy choice, but it's always the best choice and the
one that helps you learn the most powerful lessons.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Input and output are different things. We collect information by
inputing knowledge from outside, and we make sense of those knowledge by
neural-networking it within our brain and outputing it in a little
different way which requires our logical, critical, and creative
thinkings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two things happen in the brain that help us "learn what we know." One
is that we believe ideas more when we share them with others verbally,
especially if we're trying to convince others that they're true.
Psychologists call it the "saying is believing effect." Want to convince
yourself to make time to exercise three times a week? Try convincing
somebody else that they could fit a simple exercise regimen into their
schedule. Another is that speaking (and writing) brings a different part
of our brain into play than just thinking, which changes how we think
about an idea. It's one reason that we can struggle and struggle to come
up with a solution to a problem, but almost as soon as we explain the
problem to another person out loud, a good solution pops into our head.
Talking it out forces us to slow down, zoom out (simplify), and order
our thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, it's audience's engagement and support force us further
along the learning journey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned things I didn't know, and I learned what I already knew, as
Timo put it, as I analyzed leadership, considered it from different
angles, and expanded or supported my ideas. Active learners use this
process to codify their ideas into something digestible and easily
shared. When you codify it, you can scale it.</p>
<p>Teaching well also forces you to stay on top of your game, to
continually look for new material to keep your ideas current and
relevant. And it forces you to learn good storytelling, an invaluable
skill. Stories are stickier than almost any other kind of information.
If you want an idea to stay with people, you better be able to convey it
in a relevant, compelling story with emotion and tension.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Many know "people go first", few know how to do it. If you want
them to care about what you care about, you need to care about them
first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Active learners understand that people-not knowledge or
results-should be the priority. How we support people, how we show our
gratitude for them, how we show our interest or concern for them has a
much greater impact, especially over time, than the latest quarterly
earnings or the latest market rankings. I've said it before: I really
like to win. But you don't win for long if the people who make the
winning possible don't know how much they count.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have always admired Geoff Colvin, senior editor-at-large of Fortune
magazine and author of books like Talent Is Overrated and Humans Are
Underrated. When he joined me on my podcast, he described the kinds of
high-value work that only humans can do and that technology or AI can't:
empathy, collaboration, and the insights or learning we generate along
the way.</p>

<li>According to <em>The Happiness Trap</em> by Russ Harris (Acceptance

how to get A’s. But to produce someone capable of real vision, high

<p>Venture capital in 2025 is a dying industry clinging to AI as its
last hope, with most investment funneled into OpenAI and a few other
hyped players while the rest of the startup ecosystem collapses. The
sector, which thrived on zero-interest-rate euphoria, now faces a harsh
reality: no exits, frozen IPOs, and a market unwilling to fund
early-stage ventures. VCs blame Trump’s chaotic tariffs—despite many
having supported him—but the real issue is their own inability to adapt
to a normal economy. The NVCA report offers no solutions, just desperate
optimism, as the industry’s leaders—many of whom lucked into
success—flail in ideological fringe movements and pray for a miracle.
The only remaining question is whether AI will keep the bubble inflated
long enough for them to cash out before it all implodes.</p>

<p>why it's so hard to shift from lagacy automaker to SDV (software

<ul>
<li>Cultural shift: Legacy automakers treated software as an
afterthought, not a core product. Now, they must adopt a Silicon
Valley-like approach.</li>
<li>Supplier dependence: Traditional automakers rely on suppliers for
ECUs, creating a tangled web of software layers.</li>
<li>Safety vs. agility: They must balance "move fast and break things"
with "zero defects or recalls."</li>
<li>Hybrid challenges: Slowing EV demand means SDV systems must also
work with internal-combustion vehicles, complicating power and update
logistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Legacy automakers must become software companies to survive, but the
transition is painfully slow and expensive. The winners will be those
who can blend Silicon Valley speed with automotive-grade
reliability—something no traditional automaker has fully achieved

<p>The most inspiring leaders today aren’t just adapting—they’re
<strong>rewriting the rules</strong>. Leadership isn’t a pinnacle; it’s
a <strong>daily practice of courage and reinvention</strong>. The world
doesn’t need more bosses; it needs <strong>architects of
possibility</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Myth of the Omniscient Leader</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Shift: From "knowing it all" to curiosity-driven
collaboration.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Adopt a "Learn It All" mindset (Microsoft’s Satya Nadella
famously replaced "Know It All" with this).<br />
</li>
<li>Tool: Host "No Answers Meetings" where leaders openly discuss
unsolved problems, inviting teams to co-create solutions. Example:
Google’s "20% Time" empowers employees to explore innovations beyond
their core roles, democratizing problem-solving.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Embracing the Illusion of Control</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Shift: From command-and-control to adaptive
stewardship.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Practice "Scenario Planning" (like Shell Oil’s famed
strategy) to prepare for multiple futures, not just one.<br />
</li>
<li>Mindset: View volatility as a laboratory for innovation. Spotify’s
"Fail Fast, Learn Fast" approach rewards experimentation.<br />

<li>The Leadership Pipeline Crisis</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Root Cause: Short-term efficiency has gutted long-term talent
development.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix: Reverse Mentorship Programs (e.g., GE’s junior employees mentor
execs on digital trends).<br />
</li>
<li>Metric: Track "Readiness Ratios"—how many high-potentials are
prepared for next-level roles?<br />

</li>
<li>Tool: Use "Pre-Mortems" (anticipating failures before launch) to
stress-test strategies. Example: Blockbuster’s rigid playbook failed,
while Netflix’s pivot to streaming embraced uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Respect as a Daily Earned Currency</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key: Authenticity &gt; Authority.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Practice "Radical Transparency" (like Bridgewater
Associates’ culture of brutal honesty).<br />
</li>
<li>Tool: Replace "All Hands Meetings" with "All Hearts Meetings"—forums
for empathy and vulnerability. Example: Edelman’s Trust Barometer shows
employees trust "a peer like me" 3x more than CEOs.</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Antidote: Inclusive Decision-Making.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Form "Shadow Boards" (e.g., Gucci’s millennial council
advising execs).<br />
</li>
<li>Rule: For major decisions, require "Disagree &amp; Commit" (document
dissent but align once decided). Example: Patagonia’s CEO involves
employees in sustainability bets, building trust through shared
stakes.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Titles vs. Influence</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>New Power Model: Fluid Hierarchies.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Adopt "Holacracy Lite" (like Zappos’ role-based authority,
not title-based).<br />
</li>
<li>Symbolic Step: Drop "CEO" for "Chief Enabler" (as some startups do
to signal servant leadership).<br />
</li>
<li>Stat: 72% of Gen Z workers prefer "Project Leaders" over "Managers"
(McKinsey, 2024).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>The Reinvention Imperative</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Framework: "Learn, Unlearn, Relearn" (Alvin Toffler’s
future-proofing mantra).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tool: "Skills Gap Heatmaps"—quarterly self-assessments on emerging
competencies (e.g., AI literacy).<br />
</li>
<li>Example: Adobe’s "Kickbox" program gives employees $1,000 to test
new ideas, forcing leaders to adapt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Path Forward: Leadership as a Dynamic
Practice</strong></p>
<p>Your closing question—<em>"Will you be one of them?"</em>—is the call
to action. Leaders who thrive will:<br />
1. Lead with Questions, not answers.<br />
2. Treat Trust as Currency, not a given.<br />
3. Build Antifragile Teams (Nassim Taleb’s concept of growing stronger
through chaos).<br />
4. Measure Success in Learning Cycles, not quarterly profits alone.</p>

<p>This guide explores techniques such as prompt chaining, routing,
parallelization, reflection, tool integration, planning, and multi-agent
collaboration. It features practical code examples for each pattern,
enabling the development of efficient, context-aware workflows with
Google DeepMind Gemini. Emphasis is placed on structured strategies to
enhance task delegation and agent coordination.</p>

<p><em>Our research shows that by 2030, data centers are projected to
require <span class="math inline">\(\text{\$6.7}\)</span> trillion
worldwide to keep pace with the demand for compute power. Data centers
equipped to handle AI processing loads are projected to require <span
class="math inline">\(\$5.2\)</span> trillion in capital expenditures,
while those powering traditional IT applications are projected to
require <span class="math inline">\(\$1.5\)</span> trillion in capital
expenditures (see sidebar “What about non-AI workloads?”). Overall,
that’s nearly <span class="math inline">\(\$7\)</span> trillion in
capital outlays needed by 2030—a staggering number by any
measure.</em></p>
<p><em>To qualify our <span class="math inline">\(\$5.2\)</span>
trillion investment forecast for AI infrastructure, it’s important to
note that our analysis likely undercounts the total capital investment
needed, as our estimate quantifies capital investment for only three out
of five compute power investor archetypes—<strong>builders, energizers,
and technology developers and designers</strong>—that directly finance
the infrastructure and foundational technologies necessary for AI growth
(see sidebar “Five types of data center investors”). Approximately 15
percent (<span class="math inline">\(\$0.8\)</span> trillion) of
investment will flow to builders for land, materials, and site
development. Another 25 percent (<span
class="math inline">\(\$1.3\)</span> trillion) will be allocated to
energizers for power generation and transmission, cooling, and
electrical equipment. The largest share of investment, 60 percent (<span
class="math inline">\(\$3.1\)</span> trillion), will go to technology
developers and designers, which produce chips and computing hardware for
data centers. The other two investor archetypes,
<strong>operators</strong>, such as hyperscalers and colocation
providers, and <strong>AI architects</strong>, which build AI models and
applications, also invest in compute power, particularly in areas such
as AI-driven automation and data center software. But quantifying their
compute power investment is challenging because it overlaps with their
broader R&amp;D spending.</em></p>

<p><em>I'll tell you my hiring experience. We have about 30 people at
8090 and the way that I have found it to work the best is you have
senior people act as mentors and then you have an overwhelming corpus of
young very talented people who are AI native. And if you don't find that
mix, what you have instead are L7s from Google and Amazon and Meta who
come to you with extremely high salary demands and stock demands and
they just don't thrive. And part of why they don't thrive is that they
push back on the tools and how you use them. They push back on all these
things that the tools help you get to it faster. M this is why I think
it's so important for the young folks to just jump in with two feet and
be AI native from the jump because you're much more hirable frankly to
the to the emergent company and the bigger companies you'll have a lot
of these folks that see the writing on the wall may not want to adapt as
fast as otherwise. Another way for example that you can measure this is
if you look inside your company on the productivity lift of some of
these coding assistants for people as a distribution of age. What you'll
see is the younger people leverage it way more and have way more
productivity than older folks. And I'm not saying that as an aegis
comment. I'm saying that it's an actual reflection of how people are
reacting to these tools. What you're describing is a paradigm shift. It
is a big leap. Is you know it's like when I went to college, when I took
computer science, it was object-oriented programming. It was like C++.
It was compiled languages. It was gnarly. It was nasty work. And then
you had these highle abstracted languages. And I used to remember at
Facebook, I would just get so annoyed because I was like, why is
everybody using PHP and Python? This is like not even real. But I was
one of these old lights who didn't understand that I just had to take
the leap. And what it did was it grew the top of the funnel of the
number of developers by 10x. And as a result, what you had were all of
these advancements for the internet. And I think what's happening right
now is akin to the same thing where you're going to grow the number of
developers upstream by 10x. But in order to embrace that, you just have
to jump in with two feet. And if you're very rigid in how you think the
job should be done technically, I think you're just going to get left
behind. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<p>The author’s call to "lean into human strengths while actively
engaging with AI" is a compelling middle path. The essay underscores
that the future belongs to those who combine AI literacy with
irreplaceable human skills—judgment, influence, and adaptability.</p>
<p><strong>Human Competitive Advantages</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Judgment &amp; Conviction</strong>: Ability to make
decisions with incomplete/ambiguous data. Distinguishing impactful work
from "interesting but useless" projects. Simplifying complexity into
actionable frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Influence &amp; Execution</strong>: Navigating
organizational politics and incentives. Building trust and adoption for
AI-driven outputs. Understanding unspoken processes and
relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actionable Skills to Cultivate</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop "taste" by studying excellence in your field.</li>
<li>Gain hands-on experience to pressure-test AI outputs.</li>
<li>Learn to align stakeholders and drive consensus.</li>
<li>Build strong interpersonal relationships and reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adaptability as the Ultimate Skill</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI will keep evolving, so continuous learning and flexibility are
critical.</li>
<li>Focus on areas where humans add unique value (judgment, influence,
creativity).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very interesting point: "Develop "taste" by studying
excellence in your field."</p>
<p>Just like any skill, taste sharpens with exposure and effort. The
more you study, critique, and create, the better you’ll get at
recognizing—and producing—excellence. In a world flooded with
AI-generated content, the people who thrive will be those who can
separate the remarkable from the mediocre.</p>

<p>Interpretability isn’t just academic—it’s a prerequisite for safe,
controllable AI. The window to solve it is narrowing as AI grows more
powerful. By steering resources toward this goal now, we might avoid a

<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Timeline for Disruption:
<ul>
<li>By 2030: 30% of U.S. jobs could be automated (McKinsey).</li>
<li>By 2035: White-collar restructuring in finance, legal, and media
(Larry Fink, Jamie Dimon).</li>
<li>By 2045: 50% of jobs may be fully automated (Goldman Sachs).</li>
<li>By 2050: AI could dominate 60-80% of jobs, depending on innovation
pace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Most Vulnerable Jobs (Near-Term):
<ul>
<li>Administrative: Data entry, scheduling, customer service (60%
automatable, per IPPR).</li>
<li>Finance &amp; Legal: Bookkeeping, contract drafting, paralegal work
(AI tools like Harvey already achieve 90% accuracy).</li>
<li>Creative &amp; Media: Basic graphic design, copywriting, journalism
(30% at risk by 2035, Pew Research).</li>
<li>Routine STEM Tasks: Coding, data analysis (40% automatable by 2040,
WEF).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More Resilient Jobs (Longer-Term):
<ul>
<li>Healthcare: Nursing, therapy, and patient care (empathy-driven
roles).</li>
<li>Skilled Trades: Construction, repair, maintenance (physical labor is
harder to automate).</li>
<li>Education &amp; Leadership: Teaching, high-level management
(requires emotional intelligence).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To protect career:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on critical thinking, creativity, and AI collaboration (e.g.,
prompt engineering, AI-augmented decision-making).</li>
<li>Target Resilient Sectors- Healthcare, education, skilled trades, and
AI-adjacent roles (e.g., cybersecurity, AI ethics).</li>
<li>Push for employer or government-sponsored programs to transition
into hybrid (human + AI) roles.</li>
<li>Embrace Hybrid Roles- Jobs that combine technical skills with human
judgment (e.g., AI-assisted healthcare diagnostics) will thrive.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Ray Dalio warns, the economy faces a "great deleveraging" where AI
disrupts jobs faster than new ones emerge. The key is
<strong>adaptability</strong>—those who proactively reinvent their
skills today will shape the workforce of tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Curation is the new leadership superpower. Here are 3 ways to
adopt a curation mindset - FastCompany</strong> [<a

</blockquote>
<p>The most transformative leaders of the next decade will be those who
master the art of curation—seeing their role as a conduit for the best
ideas, not the source of them.</p>
<p>The Obsolescence of the "Omniscient Leader": The pace of change,
hyper-specialization, and interconnected challenges (e.g., AI, climate,
global markets) make it impossible for one person to have all the
answers. Leaders must shift from being "the smartest in the room" to
becoming "architects of collective intelligence."</p>
<p><strong>Curation as the Core Leadership Skill:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Curating Talent: Prioritize cognitive diversity over homogeneity.
Example: Diverse teams solve problems faster (39% efficiency
boost).</li>
<li>Curating Ideas: Create systems where unconventional thinking
flourishes (e.g., Google’s 20% time → Gmail, Maps). Actively seek
"outliers" (contrarians, outsiders) to challenge groupthink.</li>
<li>Curating Innovation: Design for "structured serendipity" (e.g.,
Pixar’s open office, IDEO’s cross-industry brainstorming). Embrace
cross-disciplinary collisions (e.g., NASA’s tech inspiring sportswear,
biomimicry in architecture).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How to Cultivate a Curation Mindset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitate, don’t dictate: Ask better questions; let solutions
emerge from debate (e.g., Amazon’s "Disagree and Commit").</li>
<li>Optimize for collaboration, not just efficiency: Space matters
(physical or virtual).</li>
</ul>

<p>Leaders who master systems thinking don’t just survive
uncertainty—they <strong>thrive in it</strong>, turning complexity into
competitive advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Five Key Tools of Systems Thinking for Strategic
Leaders</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Problem Statements: Move from surface-level fixes to systemic
solutions. Example: Instead of asking, <em>“How do we get customers to
recycle?”</em>, ask, <em>“How can we redesign products and
infrastructure for circularity?”</em></li>
<li>Stakeholder Mapping: Identify all affected parties—not just obvious
ones. Example: For electric vehicles, consider miners of critical
minerals, urban planners, and regulators, not just automakers and
buyers.</li>
<li>Iceberg Analysis: Look beneath visible events to uncover hidden
structures and mindsets. Example: Employee burnout isn’t just about
workload—it’s shaped by corporate culture, incentive systems, and
societal norms.</li>
<li>Causal Loops: Visualize feedback loops to see how actions create
ripple effects. Example: A cost-cutting measure in one department may
increase inefficiencies elsewhere.</li>
<li>Iteration &amp; Testing: Embrace adaptive strategies, not rigid
plans. Example: Pilot small-scale solutions, measure impact, and refine
before full rollout.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Srinivas’s journey highlights resilience, speed, and Silicon Valley’s
tight-knit founder network as key drivers of startup success.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>"It’s Only Over When You Give Up" – Aravind Srinivas, CEO of AI
search startup Perplexity, draws inspiration from Elon Musk’s
perseverance during SpaceX’s early failures. He told Harvard students
that success comes from relentless self-belief, even when others doubt
you.</li>
<li>Rocketing Valuation – Perplexity, competing with Google and OpenAI,
grew from a 1B to 9B and is now in talks to raise funds at an 18B
valuation.</li>
<li>Forget Pitch Decks, Build Fast – Srinivas advises founders to focus
on rapid product iteration rather than lengthy business plans. He admits
he doesn’t even know how to make a pitch deck—Perplexity’s success came
from live demos.</li>
<li>OpenAI Alumni Network – Despite competing with OpenAI, Srinivas
maintains a strong relationship with Sam Altman (his former boss at
OpenAI). This mirrors the "PayPal Mafia" dynamic, where ex-OpenAI
employees now lead major AI firms like Anthropic and Safe
Superintelligence.</li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Core Lessons:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Hard Work ≠ Visibility</strong>: Doing great work is
necessary but insufficient. If leaders don’t know what you’re doing,
they can’t reward it. Waiting for annual reviews is too late—visibility
requires consistent, intentional updates.</li>
<li><strong>Humility Has a Hidden Cost</strong>: While modesty is
admirable, staying silent can render you invisible. Gallup’s data on
declining engagement (just 36% in 2020) highlights how disengagement
hurts promotion prospects. Visibility isn’t ego-driven; it’s about
ensuring your impact is recognized.</li>
<li><strong>Visibility ≠ Bragging</strong>: Framing contributions as
useful knowledge (e.g., "Here’s how I solved X") builds trust and
leadership credibility. Sharing wins, failures, and best practices helps
the team and positions you as a problem-solver.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Ways to Increase Visibility</strong>
<ul>
<li>Share knowledge: Lead "lessons learned" sessions or contribute to
internal newsletters.</li>
<li>Mentor others: Their success reflects your leadership.</li>
<li>Speak up strategically: One substantive insight per meeting &gt;
empty chatter.</li>
<li>Volunteer for high-impact projects: Align with organizational
priorities.</li>
<li>Write internally: Document best practices to showcase thought
leadership.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Matters More Than
Extroversion</strong>
<ul>
<li>Visibility is about meaningful engagement, not being the
loudest.</li>
<li>Avoid self-deprecating language ("I’m sorry, but…")—speak with
conviction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>What Leaders Actually Notice</strong>
<ul>
<li>Initiative, influence, and alignment with goals matter more than
face-time.</li>
<li>Working smart (not just late) and collaborating effectively signal
leadership potential.</li>
</ul></li>

<p><em>Suffering is mostly mental anguish and mental pain and it just
means you don't want to do the task at hand.</em></p>
<p><em>The kind of fame that pure actors and celebrities have, I
wouldn't want, but the kind of fame that's earned because you did
something useful, why dodge that.</em></p>
<p><em>People will always want more status uh but I think you can be
satisfied at a certain level of wealth.</em></p>
<p><em>Not the kind of confidence that would say I have the answer but
the kind of confidence that I will figure it out and I know what I want
or only I am a good arbiter of what I want.</em></p>
<p><em>Pride is the enemy of learning, so when I look at my friends and
colleagues, the ones who are still stuck in the past and have grown the
least are the ones who were the proudest, because they sort of feel like
they already had the answers and so they don't want to correct
themselves publicly.</em></p>
<p><em>I think everybody puts themselves first that's just human nature,
you're here because you survive you're a separate organism.</em></p>
<p><em>The happier you are, the more you can sustain doing something,
the more likely you're going to do something that will in turn make you
even happier, and you'll continue to do it, and you'll outwork everybody
else. The more free you are the better you can allocate your
time.</em></p>
<p><em>There are no problems in the real world other than maybe things
that inflict pain on your body. Everything else has to become a problem
in your mind first.</em></p>
<p><em>Your family is broken but you're going to fix the world. People
are running out there to try and fix the world when their own lives are
a mess.</em></p>
<p><em>I think the only true test of intelligence is if you get what you
want out of life and there are two parts to that one is getting what you
want so you know how to get it and the second is wanting the right
things knowing what to want in the first place.</em></p>
<p><em>Usually I think people end up there because they are going on
autopilot with sort of societal expectations or other people's
expectations or out of guilt or out of like mimetic desire.</em></p>
<p><em>Probably the biggest regret will be staying in the relationship
after you knew it was over, exactly you should have left sooner, the
moment you knew it wasn't going to work out, you should have moved
on.</em></p>
<p><em>We are naturally hardwired to be pessimists but modern society is
very different despite whatever problems you may have with modern
society, it is far far safer than living in the jungle and just trying
to survive and the opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>Leave all those labels alone. It's better just to look at the
problem at hand, look at reality the way it is, try to take yourself out
of the equation in a sense.</em></p>
<p><em>The less you think about yourself the more you can think about a
mission or about God or about a child or something like that.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't think there are any formulas i think it's unique to each
person it's like asking a successful person how did you become
successful each one of them will give you a different story uh you can't
follow anyone else's path.</em></p>
<p><em>A lot of change is more about desire and understanding than it is
about uh forcing yourself or trying to domesticate yourself.</em></p>
<p><em>When your mind is under stress, it's because it has two
conflicting desires at once... and anxiety I think is sort of this
pervasive unidentifiable stress where you're just kind of stressed out
all the time and you're not even sure why and you can't even identify
the underlying problem. I think the reason for that is because you have
so many unresolved problems unresolved stress points that have piled up
in your life that you can no longer identify what the problems
are.</em></p>
<p><em>Life is going to play out the way it's going to play out there
will be some good and some bad most of it is actually just up to your
interpretation.</em></p>
<p><em>The gut is what decides the head, is kind of what rationalizes it
afterwards, the gut is the ultimate decision maker.</em></p>
<p><em>You can't change other people, you can change your reaction to
them.</em></p>
<p><em>If you do want to change someone's behavior, I I think the only
effective way to do it is to compliment them when they do something you
want, not to insult them or be negative or critical when they do
something you don't want.</em></p>
<p>If you can't decide, the answer is no.</p>
<p><em>Almost invariably the advice that you would give yourself 10
years ago is still the advice that you need to hear today.</em></p>
<p><em>On mental things, I think understanding is way more important
once you see the truth of something you cannot unsee it... when we
really do see something clearly, it changes our behavior immediately,
and that is far more efficient than trying to change your behavior
through repetition.</em></p>
<p><em>Truth is often painful, if it wasn't, we'd all be seeing truth
all the time. Reality is always reflecting truth that's all it is why
would you not have accessed it already exactly... wisdom is the set of
things that cannot be transmitted. If they could be transmitted you know
we'd read the same five philosophy books, and we'd all be done, we'd all
be wise. You have to learn it for yourself, it has to be rediscovered
for yourself in your own context.</em></p>
<p><em>You're probably better off only caring about things that are
local or things that you can affect. So if you really care about
something that's in the news, then by all means care about it but make a
difference go do something about it.</em></p>
<p><em>Desire is a contract to be unhappy until you get what you
want.</em></p>
<p><em>The real currency of life is attention it's what you choose to
pay attention to and and what you do about it.</em></p>

<p>Key Learnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone who can do the job peacefully or happily is more effective
than someone with unnecessary emotional turmoil</li>
<li>Fame sought for its own sake is fragile and leads to a constant need
to perform.</li>
<li>People often say things they don't really believe, driven by a
desire to be seen as something they are not.</li>
<li>Status is zero-sum and insatiable, unlike wealth. Status is often
comparative, like leaderboards, where one person's gain can be another's
loss.</li>
<li>Self-esteem comes from aligning actions with internal values,
especially when difficult. Genuine sacrifice, doing something you want
less for something you value more, can build self-esteem.</li>
<li>True confidence is not having all the answers but the self-belief to
figure things out.</li>
<li>Pride is an enemy of learning and can lead to being stuck in past
mistakes.</li>
<li>Everyone puts themselves first; unapologetic self-prioritization is
rare but perhaps more honest. Much of what appears as altruism might be
a waste of time if it goes against one's true desires.</li>
<li>Happiness and freedom are intertwined with efficiency and
productivity.</li>
<li>Many emotional problems arise from the mind creating problems where
none exist in the real world. He advises observing one's thoughts
objectively to realize unnecessary emotional energy expenditure.</li>
<li>People often try to fix the world while their own lives are in
disarray. He questions the credibility of those who cannot manage their
own lives but seek to solve global issues.</li>
<li>True intelligence is getting what you want out of life by wanting
the right things and knowing how to get them.</li>
<li>Many people go through life unconsciously following societal or
mimetic desires. He emphasizes the importance of thinking things through
for oneself rather than blindly following others.</li>
<li>Staying too long in bad situations (relationships, jobs) is a common
regret.</li>
<li>We are naturally hardwired for pessimism due to evolutionary
pressures to avoid ruin.</li>
<li>Humans are dynamic and labels like optimist, pessimist, introvert,
extrovert are self-limiting.</li>
<li>Overthinking about oneself can lead to misery; focusing on something
bigger can bring happiness. Overthinking and rumination do not help with
happiness.</li>
<li>There are no universal formulas for success or happiness; each
person's path is unique.</li>
<li>Lasting change comes from desire and understanding, not forcing
oneself. He suggests aligning actions with genuine wants for maximal
effectiveness.</li>
<li>Anxiety often stems from having many unresolved and conflicting
desires.</li>
<li>Our interpretations of experiences shape our reality. The same
experience can lead to different emotional responses based on individual
interpretation.</li>
<li>The "gut" is the ultimate decision-maker, representing refined
judgment accumulated through evolution and experience. He advises
trusting this instinct once it's developed.</li>
<li>You cannot change other people, only your reaction to them. He adds
that people change through their own insights or trauma, not by being
told to.</li>
<li>Negative reinforcement is less effective than positive reinforcement
in changing behavior.</li>
<li>If faced with a difficult choice and unable to decide, the answer is
often "no." He also suggests that when choosing between two equal
options, take the more painful path in the short term.</li>
<li>Understanding is more important than discipline for mental
change.</li>
<li>Truth, though often painful, is constantly reflected by reality;
wisdom is the personal rediscovery and contextual application of
timeless truths. He also mentions that many important life lessons are
"unteachable" in the sense that they must be experienced firsthand to be
truly understood.</li>
<li>Memorization is becoming less valuable in the age of readily
available information; understanding, judgment, and taste are more
crucial. He links understanding to solving real problems and finding
generalizable truths.</li>
<li>Philosophy evolves with new knowledge and perspectives. He explains
how advancements in science and technology lead to different
philosophical outlooks, and even moral philosophy progresses over
time.</li>
<li>Many philosophical paradoxes can be resolved by considering
different scales and timeframes. Naval suggests that seemingly
contradictory questions like free will and determinism can be understood
by shifting perspectives.</li>
<li>Coordination is essential for societal function; pure libertarianism
is unsustainable.</li>
<li>Modern AI, while powerful, currently lacks true creativity and deep
understanding.</li>
<li>Meaning can be more important than moment-to-moment happiness.</li>
<li>In an age of news saturation, it's a battle to maintain focus on
what truly matters and what one can influence. He emphasizes that
attention is the real currency of life and should be spent consciously.
Attention, not time or money, is the most fundamental resource in
life.</li>
<li>Getting past one's past is a skill achieved by processing it to be
rid of it, not to dwell on it.</li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A2A is an open-source protocol backed by 50+ tech giants (e.g.,
Salesforce, SAP, Cohere) and consultancies (e.g., Accenture, Deloitte).
It allows agents from different vendors/frameworks to communicate, share
data, and coordinate tasks without being locked into a single
platform.</li>
<li>Solving Enterprise Pain Points: Breaks down silos by letting agents
interoperate across HR (Workday), CRM (Salesforce), ERP (SAP), and other
systems. Example: A hiring manager’s agent can autonomously source
candidates, schedule interviews, and run background checks by
collaborating with specialized agents.</li>
<li>Design Principles:
<ul>
<li>Agent-Centric: Supports unstructured, multi-agent collaboration
(beyond rigid "tool" roles).</li>
<li>Built on Standards: Uses HTTP, JSON-RPC, and SSE for easy
integration.</li>
<li>Secure by Default: Enterprise-grade auth (aligned with
OpenAPI).</li>

Breakthrough - Dwarkesh Partel</strong> [<a

</blockquote>
<p>Satya Nadella discusses AI, AGI skepticism, economic growth, quantum
computing, AI pricing, gaming models, and legal challenges. Notes of
insights impressed me:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Nadella believes hyperscalers (like Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google
Cloud) will be major beneficiaries of AI advancements. The exponential
growth in compute demand for AI workloads—both for training and
inference—will drive massive infrastructure needs. Hyperscalers are
well-positioned to meet this demand due to their ability to scale
compute, storage, and AI accelerators efficiently.</li>
<li>He argues that hyperscale infrastructure is not a winner-takes-all
market. Enterprises and corporations prefer multiple suppliers to avoid
dependency on a single vendor. This structural dynamic ensures
competition and prevents monopolization.</li>
<li>While there may be a few dominant closed-source AI models, Nadella
predicts that open-source alternatives will act as a check, preventing
any single entity from monopolizing the AI model space. He draws
parallels to the coexistence of closed-source (e.g., Windows) and
open-source systems in the past.</li>
<li>He highlights that governments worldwide are unlikely to allow
private companies to dominate AI entirely. Regulatory and state
involvement will likely shape the landscape, further preventing a
winner-takes-all scenario.</li>
<li>In consumer markets, network effects can lead to winner-takes-all
dynamics (e.g., ChatGPT's early success). However, in enterprise
markets, multiple players will thrive across different categories.</li>
<li>He disagrees with the notion that AI models or cloud infrastructure
will become commoditized. At scale, the complexity of managing
hyperscale infrastructure and the know-how required to optimize it
create significant barriers to entry and sustain profitability.</li>
<li>Microsoft aims to build a versatile hyperscale fleet capable of
handling large training jobs, inference workloads, and specialized tasks
like reinforcement learning (RL). The company focuses on distributed
computing, global data center placement, and high utilization of
resources to meet diverse AI demands.</li>
<li>Nadella envisions a future where AI agents and specialized models
will drive even greater compute demand. He emphasizes the importance of
building infrastructure that can support both training and inference at
scale, while also accommodating evolving AI research and
development.</li>
<li>Microsoft Research (MSR) has a history of investing in fundamental,
curiosity-driven research, often with no immediate payoff. Nadella
emphasizes the importance of maintaining this culture, even if the
benefits may only materialize decades later. Nadella highlights the
difficulty of transitioning from research breakthroughs to scalable
products. The role of leadership is to ensure that innovations are not
only technically sound but also commercially viable.</li>
<li>Nadella envisions quantum computing being accessed via APIs, similar
to how cloud services are used today. This could democratize access to
quantum capabilities for research and industry.</li>
