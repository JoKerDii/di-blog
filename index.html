<p><em>Lastly, the crux of the tweet: "Optimistic contrarians are the
rarest breed." This speaks to individuals who possess the courage to
deviate from the mainstream not for the sake of contrariness, but driven
by genuine belief in a different, often better vision. More importantly,
they do this with optimism. Unlike cynics, optimistic contrarians see
the potential in what others dismiss. They are hopeful about their
divergent views, even in the face of criticism or skepticism. They
combine the audacity to think differently with the belief that their
path, though less traveled, is full of promise.</em></p>

[<a

</blockquote>
<p>The three frameworks Dan Koe lays out are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Beginner – The Micro Story</strong></p>
<p>This is meant for fast articulation in short-form writing or
speech.</p>
<p>Best for: quick clarity and attention</p>
<p>A simple storytelling structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem – state a relatable problem</li>
<li>Amplify – show the negative consequences if it’s not solved</li>
<li>Solution – present the insight or fix</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Intermediate – The Pyramid Principle</strong></p>
<p>This works especially well for podcasts, presentations, and longer
explanations.</p>
<p>Best for: structured thinking and credibility</p>
<p>A logic-first communication framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the main idea or conclusion</li>
<li>Support it with 3–5 key arguments</li>
<li>Back those up with evidence, examples, or data</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Advanced – Cross-Domain Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>This is best suited for newsletters, essays, talks, or long-form
content.</p>
<p>Best for: originality and thought leadership</p>
<p>A deeper, more original structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem + amplify (clear, relatable setup)</li>
<li>Cross-domain synthesis (borrow concepts from other fields to explain
the idea)</li>
<li>Unique process or solution (your own framework or steps)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><em>The difference between average and great is taste.</em></p>
<p><em>The future belongs to those who can filter signal from noise.
When anyone can produce anything, choosing what deserves to exist
becomes the skill.</em></p>
<p><em>The ability to learn any skill fast, however, will.</em></p>
<p><em>Devon Eriksen talks about the “liberating arts,” the skills that
free people have always needed to act on their own behalf:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Logic</strong>: deriving truth from known
facts</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Statistics</strong>: understanding the implications of
data</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Rhetoric</strong>: persuading, and spotting persuasion
tactics</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Research</strong>: gathering information on unknown
subjects</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Psychology</strong>: discerning the true motives of
yourself and others</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Investment</strong>: managing and growing
assets</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Agency</strong>: deciding what to pursue and acting
without permission</em></li>

<p><em>If your thoughts are average, they can be compressed.</em></p>
<p><em>If your ideas are derivative, they can be predicted.</em></p>
<p><em>If your personality is shaped by trends, you can be simulated —
and eventually replaced.</em></p>
<p><em>The more you become like everyone else, the more you
disappear.</em></p>
<p><em>To be incompressible is to break the pattern. To do something
that hasn’t been done. To think what hasn’t been thought. To speak in a
voice that’s unmistakably yours.</em></p>
<p><em>It means cultivating taste that isn’t algorithmic.</em></p>
<p><em>It means being boring to the AI and fascinating to the
human.</em></p>
<p><em>Most of all, incompressibility requires solitude. Silence.
Reflection.</em></p>

<p><em>Naval’s line, “If you don’t commit to meaningful work, life will
fill your time with busywork,” is a reminder of a quiet truth: your time
will never stay empty. Something will always come in. The choice is
whether it’s chosen by you, or assigned to you by circumstance,
employers, algorithms, or the thousand tiny demands that chip away at
your attention.</em></p>
<p><em>Meaningful work, on the other hand, rarely arrives disguised as
something urgent. It doesn’t ping, buzz, or demand anything. It
whispers. It waits. It requires intention. It asks you to choose it
repeatedly, often against comfort, against convenience, against the easy
path. It’s the book unwritten, the skill unmastered, the company
unstarted, the craft unrefined. The things that make your life bigger
but don’t shout for your attention.</em></p>

<p><strong>How to fix your entire life in 1 day - Dan Koe</strong>
[Link]</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>You aren't where you want to be because you aren't the
person who would be there.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>You aren't where you want to be because you don't want to
be there.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>You aren't where you want to be because you are afraid to
be there.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The life you want lies within a specific level of
mind.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intelligence is the ability to get what you want out of
life.</strong></p>
<p>Cybernetics illustrates the properties of intelligent systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>To have a goal.</li>
<li>Act toward that goal.</li>
<li>Sense where you are.</li>
<li>Compare it to the goal.</li>
<li>And act again based on that feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>To become more intelligent, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reject the known path</li>
<li>Dive into the unknown</li>
<li>Set new, higher goals to expand your mind</li>
<li>Embrace the chaos and allow for growth</li>
<li>Study the generalized principles of nature</li>
<li>Become a deep generalist</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>How to launch a completely new life in one
day</strong></p>
<p>Three phases that people go through to successfully flip their
identity:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dissonance – They feel like they don’t belong in their current life,
and become sufficiently fed up with their lack of progress.</li>
<li>Uncertainty – They don’t know what comes next, so they either
experiment or get lost and feel worse.</li>
<li>Discovery – They discover what they want to pursue and make 6 years
of progress in 6 months.</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions make you aware of the pain in your current life:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What is the dull and persistent dissatisfaction you've learned to
live with? Not the deep suffering but what you've learned to tolerate.
(if you don't hate it, you will tolerate it)</li>
<li>What do you complain about repeatedly but never actually change?
Write down the three complaints you've voiced most often in the past
year.</li>
<li>For each complaint: what would someone who watched your behavior
(not your words) conclude that you actually want?</li>
<li>What truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit to
someone you deeply respect?</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions to come up with your anti vision - a brutal awareness of
the life you dod not want to live:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If absolutely nothing changes for the next five years, describe an
average Tuesday. Where do you wake up? What does your body feel like?
What’s the first thing you think about? Who’s around you? What do you do
between 9am and 6pm? How do you feel at 10pm?</li>
<li>Now do it but for ten years. What have you missed? What
opportunities closed? Who gave up on you? What do people say about you
when you’re not in the room?</li>
<li>You’re at the end of your life. You lived the safe version. You
never broke the pattern. What was the cost? What did you never let
yourself feel, try, or become?</li>
<li>Who in your life is already living the future you just described?
Someone five, ten, twenty years ahead on the same trajectory? What do
you feel when you think about becoming them?</li>
<li>What identity would you have to give up to actually change? (”I am
the type of person who...”) What would it cost you socially to no longer
be that person?</li>
<li>What is the most embarrassing reason you haven’t changed? The one
that makes you sound weak, scared, or lazy rather than reasonable?</li>
<li>If your current behavior is a form of self-protection, what exactly
are you protecting? And what is that protection costing you?</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions to create a minimum viable vision:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Forget practicality for a minute. If you could snap your fingers and
be living a different life in three years, not what’s realistic, what
you actually <em>want</em>? What does an average Tuesday look like? Same
level of detail as question 5.</li>
<li>What would you have to believe about yourself for that life to feel
natural rather than forced? Write the identity statement: “I am the type
of person who...”</li>
<li>What is one thing you would do this week if you were already that
person?</li>
</ol>
<p>Random questions throughout the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>11:00am: What am I avoiding right now by doing what I’m doing?</li>
<li>1:30pm: If someone filmed the last two hours, what would they
conclude I want from my life?</li>
<li>3:15pm: Am I moving toward the life I hate or the life I want?</li>
<li>5:00pm: What’s the most important thing I’m pretending isn’t
important?</li>
<li>7:30pm: What did I do today out of identity protection rather than
genuine desire? (Hint: it’s most things you do)</li>
<li>9:00pm: When did I feel most alive today? When did I feel most
dead?</li>
<li>What would change if I stopped needing people to see me as [the
identity you wrote in question 10]?</li>
<li>Where in my life am I trading aliveness for safety?</li>
<li>What’s the smallest version of the person I want to become that I
could be tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to synthesize insights:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>After today, what feels most true about why you’ve been stuck?</li>
<li>What is the actual enemy? Name it clearly. Not circumstances. Not
other people. The internal pattern or belief that has been running the
show.</li>
<li>Write a single sentence that captures what you refuse to let your
life become. This is your anti-vision compressed. It should make you
feel something when you read it.</li>
<li>Write a single sentence that captures what you’re building toward,
knowing it will evolve. This is your vision MVP.</li>
</ol>
<p>To create goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One-year lens: What would have to be true in one year for you to
know you’ve broken the old pattern? One concrete thing.</li>
<li>One-month lens: What would have to be true in one month for the
one-year lens to remain possible?</li>
<li>Daily lens: What are 2-3 actions you can timeblock tomorrow that the
person you’re becoming would simply do?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Turn your life into a video game</strong></p>
<p>Six components that lead to a good life:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-vision</strong> – What is the bane of my existence, or
the life I never want to experience again?</li>
<li><strong>Vision</strong> – What is the ideal life that I think I want
and can improve as I work toward it?</li>
<li><strong>1 year goal</strong> – What will my life look like in 1 year
time, and is that closer to the life I want?</li>
<li><strong>1 month project</strong> – What do I need to learn? What
skills do I need to acquire? What can I build that will move me closer
to the one year goal?</li>
<li><strong>Daily levers</strong> – What are the priority, needle-moving
tasks that bring my project closer to completion?</li>
<li><strong>Constraints</strong> – What am I not willing to sacrifice to
achieve my vision from the ground up?</li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong><em>2025 was the year the comfortable assumptions got
stress-tested.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>“Just scale it”?</strong> DeepSeek proved architectural
efficiency could match brute-force compute – and wiped a trillion
dollars off the market.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>“Distribution is all you need”?</strong> Despite
Microsoft’s insane lead start, OpenAI’s clear consumer and mindshare
lead, and Google’s incredible distribution, and Anthropic still beat
them all in the enterprise and coding wars.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>“America leads open source”?</strong> I count nine
competitive Chinese model releases in 2025. Meta shipped two (and
Behemoth is still MIA).</em></li>
<li><em><strong>“Bigger models = better models”?</strong>
Mixture-of-experts, inference-time compute, and distillation ate that
thesis alive.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>What actually mattered</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Great products beat distribution</em></li>
<li><em>Efficiency mattered more than scale</em></li>
<li><em>Standards emerged</em></li>

<p>The global payments industry is moving away from harmonisation and
toward persistent fragmentation. This shift is structural—not
temporary—and banks must fundamentally rethink their payment
infrastructures to remain competitive. Fragmentation is structural and
enduring. Banks that succeed will be those that embrace divergence,
modernise their core payment architectures, and treat flexibility as a
strategic advantage rather than a cost burden.</p>

<p><strong>How To Ask for Support from Senior Leaders - Yue
Zhao</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.yuezhao.coach/p/how-to-help-your-leaders-help-you">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1) Mindset Shift</strong>: People often avoid asking for help
because they see it as a sign of weakness. The author learned that
asking for help is an <em>essential leadership skill</em> — especially
when challenges exceed your control or expertise.</p>
<p><strong>2) When to Ask for Help</strong></p>
<p>You should consider asking for help when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The challenge is outside your area of expertise.</li>
<li>It requires coordination across teams you don’t control.</li>
<li>You need exceptions or decisions from leaders outside your chain of
command.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general rule: ask earlier rather than later — problems grow if
unaddressed.</p>
<p><strong>3) Types of Help to Ask For</strong></p>
<p>The article breaks down <em>effective asks</em> into levels of
involvement a leader might provide:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Be a Sounding Board</strong> — light request: listen and
give perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Give Air Cover</strong> — leader supports you publicly in
meetings or when there’s pushback.</li>
<li><strong>Be a Messenger</strong> — leader helps deliver messages you
can’t reach as easily.</li>
<li><strong>Fight With Me</strong> — leader actively advocates or argues
on your behalf (highest effort).</li>
</ol>
<p>The author suggests that asking for air cover is often the best
default: It’s low-effort for the leader and lets you drive the work
while they back you up.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Execution isn’t the bottleneck; unclear strategy
is.</strong>: Teams over-execute when strategy isn’t explicit, forcing
constant validation, rework, and reactive prioritization.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of strategy clarity creates hidden time
leaks.</strong>: Without a clear strategic “yes,” leaders and teams
struggle to say no—resulting in fragmented effort and slow
decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>An imperfect strategy is better than a silent one.</strong>:
Strategy doesn’t need to be complete to be effective; even partial
clarity reduces noise and accelerates alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy must function as a system, not a
document.</strong>: Value comes from embedding strategy into everyday
decisions, tradeoffs, and communication—not from standalone
artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived productivity can mask lack of progress.</strong>:
Teams can ship continuously while failing to move the business forward
if work isn’t anchored to a shared direction.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy is ultimately a leadership communication
discipline.</strong>: Clear, consistently reinforced strategy enables
faster decisions, greater autonomy, and compounding momentum.</li>

<p><strong>The Three-Part Framework for Seeing People
Clearly</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Seeing Your Reflection in the Window
(Self-Awareness)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can’t see others clearly unless you see your own biases,
projections, and triggers.</p></li>
<li><p>Interviews are co-created interactions; your tone, assumptions,
and values shape how the other person shows up.</p></li>
<li><p>Personality frameworks (Myers–Briggs, Big Five, self-monitoring,
etc.) are most useful when applied to yourself first.</p></li>
<li><p>Use multiple frameworks to avoid becoming trapped by a single
lens.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key idea:</strong> Misjudgment often comes from mistaking
your own internal reactions for objective insight.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Seeing the Elephants in the Room (Unconscious
Drivers)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Borrowing from Jonathan Haidt: each person has a rider (conscious
narrative) and an elephant (unconscious motivations). Interviews mostly
capture the rider; references reveal the elephant.</p></li>
<li><p>Espoused beliefs ≠ actual behavior (“espoused theory” vs. “theory
in use”).</p></li>
<li><p>High-quality reference checks are often 5–10x more valuable than
interviews, especially from trusted, calibrated observers.</p></li>
<li><p>The best signal often comes from:</p>

<li>“Table-pounding” enthusiasm</li>
<li>The dog that doesn’t bark (what’s conspicuously missing)</li>
</ul></li>

<p>​ <strong>Key idea:</strong> Humility about your limited perception is
a prerequisite for accuracy.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Seeing the Water (Context and Ecosystem)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no such thing as an “A player” in the

<li><p>People thrive or fail based on subtle environmental factors:
culture, incentives, belief loops, and feedback structures.</p></li>
<li><p>Moving someone to a new ecosystem is risky; strengths in one

<li><p>Belief from leaders and teammates can create powerful positive

<li><p>Hiring should focus on fit between person and environment, not
just raw talent.</p></li>

beyond chat boxes toward agents that proactively execute tasks and
workflows on users’ behalf, acting more like autonomous employees than

<li><strong>From human-readable to agent-readable software:</strong>
Software, content, and workflows will increasingly be designed to be
machine-legible first, enabling agents to reliably navigate, interpret,
and operate systems without brittle prompting.</li>
<li><strong>From demos to deployable voice agents:</strong> Voice AI is
crossing a threshold from novelty to production-ready systems, becoming
practical in domains like healthcare, finance, recruiting, and consumer

<p>Ray Dalio is talking about how money works, why bubbles are
inevitable, and how to think across cycles rather than chase
narratives.</p>
<p>Takeaways - what Ray Dalio explicitly believes or argues in this
episode:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Money ≠ Wealth</strong></p>
<p>Money is not real wealth; it is a claim on wealth. Wealth is real
purchasing power backed by: 1) Goods, 2) Services, 3) Productivity.
Printing money does not create wealth—it only redistributes claims on
existing wealth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Money Has Two Conflicting Functions</strong></p>
<p>Dalio defines money as: A medium of exchange; A store of wealth</p>
<p>"When debt is high and governments intervene, money often fails at
being a store of wealth." This conflict explains: 1) Inflation, 2)
Currency debasement, 3) Asset bubbles</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Debt Cycles Drive Everything</strong></p>
<p>Economies move in long-term debt cycles (50–100 years). Excessive
debt forces governments into a corner: 1) Raise taxes, 2) Cut spending,
3) Print money. Historically, they always print.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Gold Standard Ending Was a Regime Shift</strong></p>
<p>Nixon ending the gold standard (1971) permanently changed money.
Since then: 1) Money is a policy tool, not a constraint. 2) Governments
can promise more than they can actually deliver. This makes currency
risk unavoidable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bubbles Are Created by Easy Money</strong></p>
<p>Bubbles form when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money creation outpaces real economic growth</li>
<li>People extrapolate recent gains indefinitely</li>
<li>Leverage increases faster than income</li>
</ul>
<p>Dalio sees bubbles as mechanical, not moral failures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leverage Is the Silent Killer</strong></p>
<p>Most people underestimate leverage risk. Leverage: 1) Magnifies
gains, 2) Destroys you quickly when wrong</p>
<p>Liquidity disappears precisely when you need it most.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wealth Preservation &gt; Wealth Maximization</strong></p>
<p>Dalio emphasizes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Surviving bad regimes matters more than winning good
ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Losing 50% requires a 100% gain to recover.</p></li>
<li><p>The biggest mistake investors make is
over-concentration.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Diversification Is Not About Asset Count</strong></p>
<p>True diversification means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exposure to uncorrelated return drivers</p></li>
<li><p>Assets that respond differently to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Growth</p></li>
<li><p>Inflation</p></li>
<li><p>Deflation</p></li>
<li><p>Political stress</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Holding many similar assets ≠ diversification.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If You Can’t Beat the Market, Don’t Try</strong></p>
<p>Most people should not trade or time markets. Dalio believes: 1)
Humility beats confidence, 2) Process beats prediction</p>
<p>Portfolio construction matters more than asset selection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Productive Assets Are the Best Long-Term Store of
Wealth</strong></p>
<p>Dalio prefers assets that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Generate cash flows</p></li>
<li><p>Adapt to inflation</p></li>
<li><p>Represent real economic activity</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples: 1) Businesses, 2) Innovation, 3) Human capital</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gold Has a Role — But It’s Not Everything</strong></p>
<p>Gold is a hedge against: 1) Currency debasement, 2) Political
disorder. But it does not produce income. It should be part of a
portfolio, not the portfolio.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Crypto Is Unproven as a Long-Term Store of
Wealth</strong></p>
<p>Dalio’s view is cautious, not dismissive: Crypto has some
store-of-value characteristics, but: 1) No long multi-cycle history, 2)
Regulatory and political uncertainty.</p>
<p>He treats it as speculative diversification, not core
wealth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Real Estate Is Politically Vulnerable</strong></p>
<p>Real estate is easy to: 1) Tax, 2) Regulate, 3) Seize. Investors
underestimate political risk in immovable assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prediction Is Less Valuable Than Understanding
Systems</strong></p>
<p>Dalio does not believe in point forecasts. He believes in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cause–effect relationships</p></li>
<li><p>Scenario thinking</p></li>
<li><p>Probabilities, not certainties</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Five Forces Drive History</strong></p>
<p>Dalio believes every country’s trajectory is shaped by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Debt &amp; money</li>
<li>Internal conflict</li>
<li>External conflict</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Acts of nature</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>​ Ignore any one of these and your analysis is incomplete.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Technology Is the Ultimate Long-Term Wealth
Driver</strong></p>
<p>Innovation increases productivity. Productivity is the foundation of
rising living standards. Countries that innovate absorb shocks better
than those that don’t.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psychology Determines Success More Than
Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>Successful investors share:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Humility</p></li>
<li><p>Curiosity</p></li>
<li><p>Willingness to be wrong</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to learn from pain</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>​ Ego is the enemy of compounding.</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Learning Comes From Proximity</strong></p>
<p>The fastest way to learn is to be near: 1) Great thinkers, 2) Great
decision-makers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wealth Without Purpose Is Empty</strong></p>
<p>Dalio believes: 1) Legacy matters more than net worth, 2) Passing
knowledge forward is the highest form of wealth, 3) Systems and ideas
outlast money.</p></li>

<p>Adam Grant’s "<em>Think Again</em>" offers a refreshing alternative:
the power of intellectual humility. While we often define intelligence
as the ability to think and learn, Grant argues that in a rapidly
changing world, a different cognitive skill matters just as much—the
ability to rethink and unlearn.</p>
<p>Grant challenges us to abandon the mindsets of preachers,
prosecutors, and politicians in favor of thinking like a "scientist."
The core of the first section is the concept of confident
humility—having faith in your capability while appreciating how much you
have yet to learn. We must detach our opinions from our identity. By
basing who we are on our values (e.g., generosity, freedom) rather than
our specific beliefs, we can remain open to changing our minds without
losing our sense of self.</p>
<p>How do we open other people's minds? Grant suggests that logic and
data often fail because they trigger defensiveness. Instead, we should
adopt techniques like motivational interviewing, which acts as a mirror
to help people find their own motivation to change. Effective
disagreement isn't about crushing the opponent; it's about signaling
that we are reasonable and open to evolving our own views.</p>
<p>The final section tackles how we can foster a culture of rethinking
in our communities. Grant warns against binary bias—the tendency to
simplify complex issues into two opposing sides. Complexity and nuance
are actually signals of credibility. When we showcase the "shades of
gray" and admit uncertainty, we become more persuasive, not less.</p>
<p>This book is a transformative reminder that true wisdom lies not in
the certainty of our convictions, but in the confident humility to
constantly question what we don't know. And it is worth being picked up
occasionally for self-reflection to ensure we remain open to the joy of
being wrong.</p>
<p>Here are my favorite quotes from this book:</p>
<p><strong>Individual Rethinking</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recognizing our shortcomings opens the door to doubt. As we question
our current understanding, we become curious about what information we
are missing. That search leads us to new discoveries, which in turn
maintain our humility by reinforcing how much we still have to learn. If
knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great thinkers don't harbor doubts because they are impostors. They
maintain doubts because they know we're all partially blind and they are
committed to improving their sight. They don't boast about how much they
know; they marvel at how little they understand. They are aware that
each answer raises new questions, and the quest for knowledge is never
finished. A mark of lifelong learners is recognizing that they can learn
something from everyone they meet.</p>
<p>Arrogance leaves us blind to our weaknesses. Humility is a reflective
lens: it helps us see them clearly. Confident humility is a corrective
lens: it enables us to overcome those weaknesses.</p>

<p>Attachment. That's what keeps us from recognizing when our opinions
are off the mark and rethinking them. To unlock the joy of being wrong,
we need to detach. I've learned that two kinds of detachment are
especially useful: detaching your present from your past and detaching
your opinions from your identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who you are should be a question of what you value, not what you
believe. Values are our core principles in life - they might be
excellence and generosity, freedom and fairness, or security and
integrity. Basing your identity on these kinds of principles enables you
to remain open-minded about the best ways to advance them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The clearest sign of intellectual chemistry isn't agreeing with
someone. It's enjoying your disagreements with them. Harmony is the
pleasing arrangement of different tones, voices, or instruments, not the
combination of identical sounds. Creative tension makes beautiful
music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpersonal Rethinking</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Convincing other people to think again isn't just about making a good
argument - it's about establishing that we have the right motives in
doing so. When we concede that someone else has made a good point, we
signal that we are scientists trying to get to the truth. "Arguments are
often far more combative and adversarial than they need to be", Harish
told me, "You should be willing to listen to what someone else is saying
and give them a lot of credit for it. It makes you sound like a
reasonable person who is taking everything into account."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Being reasonable literally means that we can be reasoned with, that
we're open to evolving our views in light of logic and data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we gave them different kinds of reasons to donate, we triggered
their awareness that someone was trying to persuade them - and they
shielded themselves against it. A single line of argument feels like a
conversation; multiple lines of argument can become an onslaught.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Taken together, these techniques increase the odds that during a
disagreement, other people will abandon an overconfidence cycle and
engage in a rethinking cycle. When we point out that there are areas
where we agree and acknowledge that they have some valid points, we
model confident humility and encourage them to follow suit. When we
support our argument with a small number of cohesive, compelling
reasons, we encourage them to start doubting their own opinion. And when
we ask genuine questions, we leave them intrigued to learn more. We
don't have to convince them that we're right - we just need to open
their minds to the possibility that they might be wrong. Their natural
curiosity might do the rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Outside the lab, dismantling stereotypes and decreasing prejudice
rarely happen overnight; a key step is getting them to do some
counterfactual thinking: helping them consider what they would believe
if they were living in an alternative reality.</p>
<p>In psychology, counterfactual thinking involves imagining how the
circumstances of our lives could have unfolded differently. When we
realize how easily we could have held different stereotypes, we might be
more willing to update our views.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychologists find that many of our beliefs are cultural truisms:
widely shared, but rarely questioned. If we take a closer look at them,
we often discover that they rest on shaky foundations. Stereotypes don't
have the structural integrity of a carefully built ship. They're more
like a tower in the game of Jenga - teetering on a small number of
blocks, with some key supports missing. To knock it over, sometimes all
we need to do is give it a poke. The hope is that people will rise to
the occasion and build new beliefs on a stronger foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They developed the core principles of a practice called motivational
interviewing. The central premise is that we can rarely motivate someone
else to change. We're better off helping them find their own motivation
to change.</p>
<p>Motivational interviewing starts with an attitude of humility and
curiosity. We don't know what might motivate someone else to change, but
we're genuinely eager to find out. The goal isn't to tell people what to
do; it's to help them break out of overconfidence cycles and see new
possibilities. Our role is to hold up a mirror so they can see
themselves more clearly, and then empower them to examine their beliefs
and behaviors. That can activate a rethinking cycle, in which people
approach their own views more scientifically. They develop more humility
about their knowledge, doubt in their convictions, and curiosity about
alternative points of view.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Listening well is more than a matter of talking less. It's a set of
skills in asking and responding. It starts with showing more interest in
other people's interests rather than trying to judge their status or
prove our own. We can all get better at asking "truly curious questions
that don't have the hidden agenda of fixing, saving, advising,
convincing or correcting", and helping to "facilitate the clear
expression of another person's thoughts."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Collective Rethinking</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Binary bias is a basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by
simplifying a complex continuum into two categories. To paraphrase the
humorist Robert Benchley, there are two kinds of people: those who
divide the world into two kinds of people, and those who don't.</p>
<p>An antidote to this proclivity is complexifying: showcasing the range
of perspectives on a given topic. We might believe we're making progress
by discussing hot-button issues as two sides of a coin, but people are
actually more inclined to think again if we present these topics through
the many lenses of a prism. To borrow a phrase from Walt Whitman, it
takes a multitude of views to help people realize that they too contain
multitudes.</p>
<p>A dose of complexity can disrupt overconfidence cycles and spur
rethinking cycles. It gives us more humility about our knowledge and
more doubts about our opinions, and it can make us curious enough to
discover information we were lacking.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This thorny issue is a natural place to explore how we can bring more
complexity into our conversations. Fundamentally, that involves drawing
attention to the nuances that often get overlooked. It starts with
seeking and spotlighting shades of gray.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we are reading, listening, or watching, we can learn to
recognize complexity as a signal of credibility.</p>
<p>Multiple experiments have shown that when experts express doubt, they
become more persuasive. When someone knowledgeable admits uncertainty,
it surprises people, and they end up paying more attention to the
substance of the argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In a series of experiments, psychologists demonstrated that when news
reports about science included caveats, they succeeded in capturing
readers' interest and keeping their minds open.</p>
<p>New research reveals that people are more likely to promote diversity
and inclusion when the message is more nuanced (and more accurate).
Acknowledging complexity doesn't make speakers and writers less
convincing; it makes them more credible. It doesn't lose viewers and
readers; it maintains their engagement while stoking their
curiosity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What stands in the way of rethinking isn't the expression of emotion;
it's a restricted range of emotion.</p>

<p><strong>The 20-Minute Writing Exercise That Neuroscientists Say Can
Solve Your Hardest Problems - Magdalena Ponurska</strong> [<a

</blockquote>
<p>The science behind this writing exercise involves cognitive
neuroscience and functions as attentional training. It works by
simultaneously leveraging three mechanisms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Activating the Prefrontal Cortex:</strong> Writing about
solving a problem in vivid, present-tense detail activates the
prefrontal cortex, which is the brain's planning and problem-solving
center. Studies show that the brain treats this detailed written
simulation of future scenarios as a form of experience, unlike abstract
goal-setting.</li>
<li><strong>Priming the Reticular Activating System (RAS):</strong> The
writing exercise primes the RAS, which serves as the brain's filter for
determining what you notice in your environment. By writing about being
a person who "found money under rocks," the RAS starts flagging relevant
opportunities or "solution-shaped things" that were previously
overlooked.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Implementation Intentions:</strong> When you create
a detailed mental scenario of completing a task, you are creating
specific "if-then" plans known as implementation intentions. Research
indicates that this technique makes people two to three times more
likely to follow through than those who simply set abstract goals.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Articulation has nothing to do with sounding smart, but with
sounding authentic.</em></p>
<p><em>What makes someone dangerously articulate, is the willingness to
think out loud without fear of making mistakes. To make your
intellectual curiosity visible, and to embrace the possibility of not
knowing everything while speaking aloud.</em></p>
<p><em>In an uncertain world, embracing uncertainty becomes the
foundation of dangerously articulate thinking.</em></p>
<p><em>If you fear uncertainty in your life, you need to leverage
uncertainty to overcome it.</em></p>
<p><em>You need to become obsessed in your own curiosity to become
genuinely useful to others.</em></p>
<p><em>Reading feeds curiosity. Reading improves how well you ask
questions. Reading fuels better synthesis through asking better
questions. Reading makes the perspective you have to offer to the world
more valuable because you can synthesize everything you have read into
solutions that can help people.</em></p>

<li><p><em>The Translation Test: Always translate the what (the specific
task you did) into the how (the repeatable rule anyone can

Professional Who Hates Self Promotion - William Meller, You
Visible</strong> [<a

</blockquote>
<p>"The Strategy of Service</p>
<p>The core idea of Part 1 is professional relief: <strong>you don’t
have to promote yourself.</strong> The anxiety you feel is valid because
self-promotion is rooted in ego, but true visibility is rooted in
service. This is about adopting the <strong>Map
perspective</strong>-sharing the process and the failures-to eliminate
the fear of arrogance. To keep your content focused, define your
<strong>Audience of One</strong>. Finally, remember the
<strong>Translation Test</strong>: your expertise is locked inside your
company’s context; always translate internal success into a
<strong>Portable Principle</strong> the market can immediately use."</p>
<p>"The Architecture of Proof</p>
<p>Part 2 is the strategic realization that your LinkedIn profile is a
<strong>passive, magnetic sales tool</strong>. Your
<strong>Headline</strong> must be a 10-second service promise. The
<strong>About section</strong> earns trust by showing a past failure
(the scar) that led directly to your unique <strong>framework</strong>
(the solution). The most important shift is in the <strong>Experience
section</strong>-stop listing activity and start listing your
<strong>professional legacy</strong> by detailing the
<strong>mechanism</strong> you engineered and the value it created.
Finally, the <strong>Featured section</strong> provides <strong>tangible
proof</strong> of your competence, fulfilling the promise made in your
headline."</p>
<p>“The Protocol of Consistency</p>
<p>The core challenge is that visibility requires consistency, but
self-promotion is exhausting. Part 3 turns content creation into a quiet
routine. Start with the <strong>Daily Capture Ritual</strong> to source
your ideas from <strong>Friction Points</strong> and <strong>Instruction
Moments</strong>-the problems you already solved. Batch your writing
into a <strong>60-minute Weekly Creation Block</strong>, always
following the structure of <strong>Conflict, Lesson, Illustration,
Conversation.</strong> Finally, implement the <strong>Generosity
Loop</strong>-committing 5 minutes a day to provide high-value
contributions in the comments of others-which is a low-effort way to
maximize visibility through service.”</p>
<p>“The Language of Quiet Confidence</p>
<p>Part 4 focuses on refining your voice to ensure your words are
precise and evidence-based. You must eliminate the language of demand,
which erodes trust, and embrace the <strong>Language Test</strong> by
reframing your message to that of a generous teacher. The greatest tool
is the <strong>mechanism</strong>-naming the specific process or
framework you built to prove that your knowledge is systematic and
repeatable. Finally, use the word <strong>“We”</strong> to project
confident leadership and credit the process.”</p>
<p>"The Quiet Metric System</p>
<p>Part 5 provides the ultimate relief: you can officially ignore the
noisy scoreboards. True authority is not measured by vanity metrics
(Likes, views) but by <strong>Authority Metrics</strong>-specifically,
the <strong>quality</strong> of inbound opportunities and Direct
Messages that reference one of your named <strong>mechanisms</strong>.
To sustain this, enforce the <strong>Time-Box Rule</strong> for writing
and embrace the <strong>1/3 Rule</strong> to keep the focus on
low-effort engagement over high-effort creation."</p>

<p>This is a story about recognizing that financial services for growth
companies are being re-architected into three different endgames, each
optimized for a different definition of scale, control, and user
value.</p>
<p>Across all three companies (Ramp, Brex, Mercury), the real trend is
re-bundling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software is the product, not a portal layered on top</li>
<li>Automation and “zero-touch” workflows are now table stakes</li>
<li>Bundled, end-to-end platforms beat stitched-together TradFi
stacks</li>
<li>UX and workflow ownership are the new moats</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional banks aren’t dead—but they are structurally behind.</p>
<p>Two signals stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li>JPM Coin launching on Base suggests banks are moving “open loop”
on-chain</li>
<li>Stablecoins are becoming real infrastructure, not just crypto-native
tools</li>
</ul>
<p>This could reshape cross-border payments, treasury management, and
bank interoperability—potentially challenging SWIFT.</p>

as the top streaming service in the U.S. The conversation addressed
content regulation, confirming a pullback from controversial COVID-era
censorship and emphasizing YouTube’s commitment to free expression
despite the difficulty of managing diverse global laws and cultural
nuances. Crucially, Mohan revealed that YouTube is adapting to the rise
of synthetic media by developing new likeness detection tools—modeled
after Content ID—and implementing transparency labels for AI-generated
content to protect creator identities and address "AI slop."</p>

<p><strong>Lean Strategy Making, Standardizing your company’s approach
can pay off. Here’s how. - Michael Mankins, Harvard Business
Review</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2025/05/lean-strategy-making">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The essential approach to effectively implementing and sustaining a
lean strategy involves three stages. By adopting this rigorous,
standardized approach to strategy, leading companies are able to reduce
waste, move faster, make wiser choices, and gain a competitive edge.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Setting Strategic Priorities: This initial stage focuses on
defining the company’s direction and identifying the most critical
issues to address.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Articulate Performance Ambition: Lean strategy begins with
articulating or revising a multiyear performance ambition, which
encompasses both financial goals (e.g., revenue, profit) and strategic
goals (e.g., market-share growth, customer satisfaction). This ambition
is aspirational—realistic yet beyond the reach of the current
strategy—designed to motivate leaders to surface breakthrough
ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare to Multiyear Outlook (MYO): The ambition is compared
against the multiyear outlook (MYO), which projects future performance
based <em>only</em> on decisions and resource commitments already made.
The MYO is not a plan or forecast; it captures the likely trajectory if
current strategies remain unchanged and often depicts a deteriorating
competitive position.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the Gap and Strategic Backlog: There should be a sizable
gap between the ambition and the MYO; if not, the ambition should be
revised upward. This gap is closed by addressing issues on the strategic
backlog, a document capturing the company’s highest-priority strategic,
operational, organizational, and financial challenges.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize and Frame Issues: Issues on the backlog are
prioritized based on value at stake (economic impact) and
urgency/critical path. They must be described in careful detail and tied
to one or more specific decisions that must be made to resolve the
challenge.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a Decision Calendar: The final step is to create a
decision calendar, which outlines when each item on the backlog will be
addressed, establishing a steady cadence or “drumbeat” of
decision-making.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tackling Priorities in an Ongoing Fashion: Once priorities are
set, the organization engages in a continuous process of
decision-making, which follows a standard, two-session process for each
item on the backlog.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Facts and Alternatives Session: In this session, leadership works
to fully understand the issue, identify its underlying causes, and
develop a comprehensive set of viable options. It is critical to gather
facts that reveal the true reasons for underperformance, avoiding the
trap of only treating symptoms. Companies must consistently explore
multiple strong alternatives and should avoid presenting false choices
(like options too extreme or too weak). Successful companies standardize
the criteria for assessing these alternatives.</p></li>
<li><p>Choices and Commitments Session: Here, leadership reviews the
alternatives, uses agreed-upon criteria to select the best one, defines
performance milestones, and identifies required resources. The outcome
is a final decision that includes committing resources in exchange for
expected performance improvements.</p></li>
<li><p>Document and Formalize: The best companies create an explicit
decision log to capture the choices made, documenting the alternatives
considered, the rejected options, and the rationale for the chosen path,
thereby eliminating ambiguity. Strategic choices must drive resource
allocation, often formalized through a written, two-way performance
contract between the corporate center and business
units/functions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Monitoring Business Performance / Monitoring the Results: The
final stage involves continuously assessing the organization's success
and making necessary adjustments.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regular Assessment: The success of meeting performance
commitments, along with the center’s allocation of resources, is
regularly assessed at business performance reviews.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine Need for Strategic Change: These reviews should not
merely compare actual performance against the budget (like "weather
reports"); instead, the true purpose is to determine whether the company
needs to alter its strategic direction. Leaders must probe deeper into
the reasons behind performance misses.</p></li>
<li><p>Revisit or Intensify Efforts: If market or competitive conditions
have changed significantly, leadership may return an issue to the
strategic backlog to gather new facts, explore new alternatives, and
potentially make a different choice. If the facts have not changed,
leadership may choose to intensify efforts in certain areas or scale
back others to realign performance with goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance Dialogues: Companies like Amgen use performance
dialogues at executive meetings to examine execution against commitments
made on the strategic backlog, often utilizing metric-monitoring
platforms to track both leading and lagging indicators.</p></li>
<li><p>Highlight Successes: Monitoring also involves exploring the
causes of overperformance to identify successful practices that can be
replicated.</p></li>

<p><strong>What People Get Wrong About Psychological Safety, Six
misconceptions that have led organizations astray. - Amy C. Edmondson
and Michaela J.Kerrissey</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2025/05/what-people-get-wrong-about-psychological-safety">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors identify six common misconceptions that often hinder the
effective implementation of psychological safety in organizations,
leading organizations astray:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Psychological Safety Means Being Nice</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Problem: Safety and comfort are not synonyms; comfort is
ease, while safety is being protected from danger. When people
prioritize being "nice," they avoid honesty, which leads to ignorance
and mediocrity, causing coordination, quality, and learning to
suffer.</p></li>
<li><p>The Reality: Psychological safety is defined as a shared sense of
permission for candor and the belief that it is acceptable to take
interpersonal risks, such as asking questions or admitting mistakes. It
is consistent with kindness, but kindness involves being respectful,
caring, and honest, unlike "nice," which is often the easy way out of a
difficult conversation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Psychological Safety Means Getting Your Way</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Problem: An employee might complain that not having their
idea supported made them feel psychologically unsafe. This
misinterpretation implies that input must be agreed upon.</p></li>
<li><p>The Reality: Psychological safety is about ensuring that leaders
and teams hear what people think; it does not force agreement. The
ultimate goal is to reach a good decision or prevent a defect. Leaders
should not tolerate problematic behaviors like bullying or disrespect,
and they don't need to agree with every input they receive.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Psychological Safety Means Job Security</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Problem: This misconception equates psychological safety with
freedom from layoffs.</p></li>
<li><p>The Reality: Psychological safety is defined as the freedom to be
constructively candid. An employee who stood up to senior leaders and
criticized the company regarding layoffs actually demonstrated that
psychological safety existed, as they believed they could speak up
without risking their career or generating negative reactions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Psychological Safety Requires a Trade-Off with Performance</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Problem: This view is wrong, as psychological safety and
accountability are distinct dimensions. Low levels of both dimensions
clearly harm performance and morale.</p></li>
<li><p>The Reality: Superb performance in any uncertain environment
requires a commitment to both high standards and psychological safety.
Psychological safety is crucial because it enables learning by surfacing
information and knowledge vital for competing in a changing world, which
counters the tendency for people to hide information, save face, or fall
into groupthink.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Psychological Safety Is a Policy</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Problem: Psychological safety cannot be mandated, similar to
trust or motivation. Mandating it is unlikely to produce it; in fact,
telling people they must have it "or else" may cause leaders to be kept
in the dark.</p></li>
<li><p>The Reality: Psychological safety is not a quick fix or a policy;
rather, it is built interaction by interaction within a group. Creating
a climate of candor requires intention, effort, and developing skills
through tools such as messaging, modeling, and mentoring by
leaders.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Psychological Safety Requires a Top-Down Approach</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Problem: While leaders certainly matter, the misconception is
that they are the sole drivers.</p></li>
<li><p>The Reality: Psychological safety is ultimately built by everyone
at all levels of the company. It is "local," varying substantially
across different groups within the same organization. Everyone
influences the environment by showing interest in others' ideas, asking
questions to draw others out, and responding productively rather than
punitively. Focusing on your own team is an effective way to start
building a motivated, high-performing environment.</p></li>

<p><strong>The Power of Mattering at Work, Improving everyday
interactions can promote employee retention, engagement, growth, and
well-being - Zach Mercurio, Harvard Business Review</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2025/05/the-power-of-mattering-at-work">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the practical ways organizations and leaders can integrate
mattering daily:</p>
<p><strong>I. Seeing and Hearing Others</strong>: seeing people
(acknowledging them and paying attention to their life details and work
ebbs and flows) and hearing people (demonstrating real interest in their
feelings and inviting their perspectives within a climate of
psychological safety).</p>
<ul>
<li>Make Time and Space: Leaders should prioritize and plan relationship
building. This involves scheduling regular meetings, avoiding
cancellation of one-on-ones, and maximizing casual interactions, such as
"watercooler conversations" or moments before meetings start. Employees
who spend more time (over six hours a week) interacting with their
leaders are 30% more engaged.</li>
<li>Pay Deep Attention: Renew the intention to pay close attention to
transform interactions from transactional to relational.</li>
<li>Ask More Meaningful Questions: Instead of standard greetings like,
"How are you?", ask questions that provide genuine insight into the
people being led. Use questions that are:
<ul>
<li>Clear: Have an object and a time frame (e.g., “What has your
attention today?”).</li>
<li>Open: Give people the opportunity to share experiences (e.g., “What
was the most important insight you heard in the meeting?”).</li>
<li>Exploratory: Seek to understand rather than evaluate (e.g., “Which
parts of today’s projects were most challenging for you and why?”).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Listen for Total Meaning: Leaders should be alert to the "total
meaning" of what people share, including their words, demeanor, facial
expressions, and nonverbal cues, to understand their underlying feelings
and attitudes.
<ul>
<li>Seek Clarification: Ask questions like, “Can you tell me more?” or
“What do you mean when you say ‘fine’?”.</li>
<li>Paraphrase or “Loop”: Check understanding by repeating their message
(e.g., “What I hear you saying is….Is that accurate?”).</li>
<li>Articulate Feelings: Ask questions like, “How did that make you
feel?” and validate their emotions (e.g., “I can see that you’re feeling
X”).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Respond Compassionately: When learning about struggles, respond
foremost with compassion, avoiding the tendency to normalize despair at
work. Even small acts, like allowing an overloaded employee to skip a
non-essential meeting, can significantly reduce stress and increase
trust.</li>
<li>Follow Up: Note what is learned and check back in on those details
later, or make concrete changes to the business based on the feedback.
One manager successfully increased engagement by writing down one detail
about each team member weekly and scheduling a brief follow-up
micro-check-in.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Affirming People and Showing Them They Are
Needed</strong></p>
<p>Once a leader truly sees and hears a person, they can affirm them
meaningfully by showing how they make a singular impact. This involves
giving evidence that they are valued, relied upon, and
indispensable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Show People Their Unique Gifts: Affirm significance by considering
their strengths (what they love and are good at), purpose, perspective,
and wisdom. By naming and nurturing these unique gifts, leaders help
employees see how they matter.</li>
<li>Provide "Wise Feedback": When offering criticism or noting areas
needing improvement, affirmation must precede it. People are more likely
to improve when the leader believes in them, reminds them of their
strengths, offers support, and establishes trust beforehand.</li>
<li>Tell Stories of Significance: Share real, specific personal stories
to remind employees of the downstream impact of their work, especially
if they are far removed from the end user. Hearing even one such story
can increase motivation by up to 400%. Organizations should establish a
process for collecting and sharing these stories.</li>
<li>Show Indispensability through Laddering: To help people feel needed,
show how even their small tasks are crucial to a bigger goal or purpose.
The "laddering" technique links the individual's input at the bottom to
a meaningful ultimate outcome (like the organization's purpose or
vision) at the top. Each rung shows how the individual's contribution is
needed for the next tangible step, reaffirming their
indispensability.</li>
<li>Verbally Express Reliance: Tell team members how you rely on them,
remind them how the organization needs them and their work, and even ask
them for help. When people return from an absence, tell them they were
missed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Scaling the Mattering Skills
Organizationally</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that mattering becomes a cultural norm, senior leaders must
scale these skills across the organization using a focused four-step
approach.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Set the Right Intention and Increase Motivation: Leaders must
implement mattering not as a tactic to achieve profits, engagement, or
lower turnover, but because it fulfills the basic human need for dignity
and the primal need to be seen, heard, and valued. To incite motivation,
create an emotional anchor by having leaders answer and share when they
most felt they mattered and what skills the person who fostered that
feeling used.</li>
<li>Develop and Practice the Right Skills: Name the required skills
(focused on noticing, affirming, and needing) and tailor them to the
organization. This can be documented in a "leadership checklist"
defining daily behaviors or a comprehensive guidebook, such as the "How
People Matter Here" blueprint created by American Express Global
Business Travel. Specific behaviors brainstormed at that company
included proactive support when an employee discloses a struggle and
describing the “why” before “what” and “how” when assigning tasks.</li>
<li>Measure Mattering: Implement measurement and accountability, as
people often overestimate their efforts in this area.
<ul>
<li>Self-Assessment: Leaders should use a self-assessment, ideally
quarterly in a group setting for peer coaching, to rate how often they
display behaviors like remembering details of others' lives, naming
unique gifts, and telling others they are relied upon.</li>
<li>Team Assessment: To get a more accurate picture, teams should rate
their leaders on the same mattering behaviors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Optimize the Environment: Organizations must stop making it
difficult for leaders to cultivate mattering. To create a mattering
culture, reward and promote leaders for how they make people feel,
rather than solely for how much they get people to do. Incentivize and
promote leaders whose assessments demonstrate that they dignify,
include, respect, and affirm people while still performing well.</li>

<p>Interesting analogy: current LLMs are "ghosts"—statistical,
engineered intelligences deeply tied to human data—rather than
"animals"—a hypothetical, purely emergent form of AGI. The key debate is
whether this engineered "ghost" intelligence will eventually converge
toward a more "animal-like" emergent intelligence, or if it will
diverge, remaining a fundamentally different, yet powerful, kind of

<p><strong>Unlocking Pay by Bank’s Potential - Alex Johnson</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fintechtakes.com/articles/2025-10-23/unlocking-pay-by-banks-potential/">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pay by bank</strong> is any payment method that transfers
funds directly between bank accounts, but the modern definition is a
combination of electronic payment rails (ACH, RTP, FedNow) and
convenient user experiences enabled by <strong>open
banking</strong>.</p>
<p>Currently, few consumers use it (only 6.4% surveyed), but the biggest
barrier is lack of awareness (56% of non-users hadn't heard of it). Once
informed, 40% of consumers are interested or intrigued.</p>
<p>The underlying bank-to-bank payment rails are rapidly maturing, with
significant growth in Same Day ACH, RTP, and FedNow, along with improved
open banking infrastructure.</p>
<p>While lower payment processing costs (compared to credit cards) are a
strong motivator, the bigger, more strategic reason for merchants is the
ability to gather richer customer data.</p>
<p>Open banking-enabled pay by bank provides customer insights (e.g.,
historical bank transaction data) that enable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash Flow Smoothing (e.g., microloans or flexible payment
dates).</li>
<li>Personalized Offers (e.g., targeting a customer who used a
competitor).</li>
<li>Dynamic Risk Management (e.g., better authorization decisions based
on future cash flow).</li>
</ul>
<p>Challenges and Solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer Adoption: Must be fixed through education, prominent UI
placement, and compelling incentives/rewards that are tied to
customer-valued behaviors (e.g., double fuel points, loyalty
months).</li>
<li>Merchant Integration: For complex merchants, a hybrid approach could
be key—authorizing the bank payment using a virtual card through the
existing card processor infrastructure, which makes the integration
simpler.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Agentic payments memo - Kahlil Lalji</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.natural.co/blog/agentic-payments-memo">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A detailed memo written to formalize thoughts on the emerging problem
space of agentic payments—payments executed autonomously by AI agents
rather than humans.</p>
<p>Today's payment infrastructure (cards, ACH, etc.) is built for slow,
human-centric interactions. This breaks agent workflows, which need
real-time, low-latency, and low-cost transactions. The goal is to build
a new financial infrastructure—a natural language layer and
protocol—that allows agents to transact directly and autonomously across
any financial rail, starting with ACH.</p>
<p>The memo outlines several opportunities for companies building
agentic payment infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controllable Wallets: Providing agents with easy-to-manage wallets
that can be funded Just-in-Time (JIT) to control risk and
liability.</li>
<li>Authorization Tools: Creating real-time (sub-3000ms latency) tools
to approve transactions, check funds, and verify counterparty risk
synchronously.</li>
<li>Wedge Strategies: Using existing, manual workflows like Accounts
Payable/Accounts Receivable (AP/AR) as a disruption point to introduce
agent-driven automation and build the core infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prediction Markets: Understanding Their Impact and Future -
OneSafe</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.onesafe.io/blog/prediction-markets-crypto-payments-fintech">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prediction markets are platforms (like Kalshi and Polymarket) where
users trade contracts based on future event outcomes, utilizing
collective foresight to predict events better than traditional methods.
These markets generate real-time, crowd-sourced data that can be used by
fintech companies for crucial functions like risk management and fraud
detection in crypto payment systems. This data can also inform crypto
treasury APIs for better asset management.</p>
<p>A major hurdle is the legal uncertainty, as prediction markets are
often categorized between gambling and financial derivatives,
complicating compliance with state and federal laws. Compliance with AML
(Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations also
poses a burden.</p>
<p>As prediction markets mature, integrating their real-time data into
smart contracts could automate payment processes, enhance transparency,
and reduce dependence on centralized authorities, ultimately reshaping
value transfer in the digital economy.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here is what the Hiring Assistant can do in the hiring process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathers and refines hiring requirements, including role details and
specific qualifications for the job, inferring missing information when
needed.</li>
<li>Generates and runs multiple search queries against the talent
network at scale, stores potential candidate profiles, and iteratively
refines the search based on performance. It uses LinkedIn's Economic
Graph to identify top locations, skills, and talent flows.<br />
</li>
<li>Assesses candidates by synthesizing data from their profiles,
resumes, and historical engagement. It applies the hiring requirements
to produce structured recommendations, surfacing evidence to support its
reasoning.<br />
</li>
<li>Handles candidate communication, including generating and sending
initial outreach and follow-up messages. It can also reply to candidate
questions and schedule phone screens.<br />
</li>
<li>Prepares tailored screening questions and can observe, transcribe,
and summarize conversations, capturing insights and notes.<br />
</li>
<li>Continuously refines the hiring requirements and candidate
recommendations by analyzing recruiter actions (like adding candidates
to pipelines or sending messages). It uses a cognitive memory to adapt
to a recruiter's specific preferences and style over time.</li>

<p><em>We define a journey as the intersection of a user’s interests,
intent, and context at a specific point in time. A user journey is a
sequence of user-item interactions, often spanning multiple sessions,
that centers on a particular interest and reveals a clear intent — such
as exploring trends or making a purchase.</em></p>
<p><em>At a high level, we extract keywords from multiple sources and
employ hierarchical clustering to generate keyword clusters; each
cluster is a journey candidate. We then build specialized models for
journey ranking, stage prediction, naming, and expansion. This inference
pipeline runs on a streaming system, allowing us to run full inference
if there’s algorithm change, or daily incremental inference for recent
active users so the journeys respond quickly to a user’s most recent
activities.</em></p>

<p><strong>The Not-so Bitter Lesson - Marius Vach</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.mariusvach.com/posts/bitter-lesson">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The Bitter Lesson" is an argument originally proposed by computer
scientist Richard Sutton, but frames it as "The Not-so Bitter
Lesson."</p>
<ul>
<li>Sutton's Core Argument (The Bitter Lesson) states that general
methods that leverage search and compute will consistently outperform
domain-specific solutions based on human knowledge or clever insights.
The "bitter" part suggests that human-crafted domain expertise
eventually gets crushed by "dumb brute-force search and compute."</li>
<li>The Article's Key Reframing (The Not-so Bitter Lesson): The author
argues that this lesson is not bitter for engineers; instead, it's a
blueprint for better engineering. The human's job shifts from manually
crafting solutions to building the infrastructure that exposes the
search problem effectively.</li>

<p><strong>This Is How Much Anthropic and Cursor Spend On Amazon Web
Services - Edward Zitron</strong> [<a

</blockquote>
<p>The article provides exclusive data on the Amazon Web Services (AWS)
spending of Anthropic (the AI model provider) and Cursor (an AI coding
company and Anthropic's largest customer). It shows that Anthropic's AWS
spend alone for the entirety of 2024 was <span
class="math inline">\(\$1.359\)</span> billion against an estimated
revenue of up to <span class="math inline">\(\$600\)</span> million,
meaning they spent at least 200% of their revenue on AWS.</p>
<p>It concludes that Anthropic's costs are "out of control" and its
current cost of doing business is unsustainable, meaning prices for its
services must increase dramatically for the company to ever become
profitable.</p>

<p>Main points: Many impactful AI research ideas are not complex math
breakthroughs, but older, simple concepts or tricks applied to LLMs for
the first time (e.g., using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)).
The surprising success of LLMs is like a "rubber-band engine," creating
a wealth of "easy scientific questions" that are accessible to hobbyists
and non-experts. Simple, non-academic ideas like Anthropic's "skills"
(scripts for the agent) are showing the value of amateur experimentation
in rapidly discovering the unknown capabilities of new LLMs.</p>

<p>The article highlights the huge risks, including safety (a falling or
malfunctioning robot) and privacy (the collection of home data). Adcock
is pushing for a rapid first-mover advantage to create a "natural
monopoly" where more robots lead to more data, making the robot cheaper
and smarter over time.</p>
<p>The arrival of mass-produced robots is predicted to cause a societal
shock, potentially leading to widespread wealth creation through
collapsing costs, but also creating the risk of mass unemployment and
greater social inequality if not managed correctly (e.g., with a
Universal Basic Income).</p>

          <p>Being a leader requires 'followers' only, those who volunteer to go
where you are going rather than being incentivized to, threatened to, or
having to. And leadership requires a vision of the world that does not
yet exist and the ability to communicate it. The former is the tangible
result of what the world would like if we spent every day pursuing WHY,
due to the power of WHY in inspiring action. The inspirational book
'<em>Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take
Action</em>' written by Simon Sinek explores this concept deeply,
arguing that the most successful and inspiring leaders communicate from
the inside out—starting with their 'Why' (purpose or belief), then 'How'
(process), and finally 'What' (product or service). This is a very
inspiring book to read, for any type of leaders who is pursuing profound
fulfillment.</p>

<p>Below are the quotations I've selected from the book.</p>
<p><strong>Manipulations are the norm, but the better alternative is
inspiration</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the business world, manipulations are the norm in politics
today as well. Just as manipulations can drive a sale but not create
loyalty, so too can they help a candidate get elected, but they don't
create a foundation for leadership. Leadership requires people to stick
with you through thick and thin. Leadership is the ability to rally
people not for a single event, but for years. In business, leadership
means that customers will continue to support your company even when you
slip up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Manipulative techniques have become such a mainstay in American
business today that it has become virtually impossible for some to kick
the habit. Like any addiction, the drive is not to get sober, but to
find the next fix faster and more frequently. And as good as the
short-term highs may feel, they have a deleterious impact on the
long-term health of an organization. Addicted to the short-term results,
business today has largely become a series of quick fixes added on one
after another after another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Leaders who choose to inspire people rather than manipulate
people follow the concept of 'The Golden Circle'.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Golden Circle is an alternative perspective to existing
assumptions about why some leaders and organizations have achieved such
a disproportionate degree of influence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This alternative perspective is not just useful for changing the
world; there are practical applications for the ability to inspire, too.
It can be used as a guide to vastly improve leadership, corporate
culture, hiring, product development, sales, and marketing. It even
explains loyalty and how to create enough momentum to turn an idea into
a social movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Companies try to sell us WHAT they do, but we buy WHY they do it.
This is what I mean when I say they communicate from the outside in;
they lead with WHAT and HOW. When communicating from inside out,
however, the WHY is offered as the reason to buy and the WHATs serve as
the tangible proof of that belief. The things we can point to
rationalize or explain the reasons we're drawn to one product, company
or idea over another.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the WHY is absent, imbalance is produced and manipulations
thrive. And when manupulations thrive, uncertainty increases for buyers,
instability increases for sellers and stress increases for all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Biologically, the limbic brain drives behaviors (decisions).
Great leaders win hearts before minds.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are drawn to leaders and organizations that are good at
communicating what they believe. Their ability to make us feel like we
belong, to make us feel special, safe, and not alone is part of what
gives them the ability to inspire us. Those whom we consider great
leaders all have an ability to draw us close and to command our loyalty.
And we feel a strong bond with those who are also drawn to the same
leaders and organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The newest area of the brain, our Homo Sapien brain, is the
neocortex, which corresponds with the WHAT level. The neocortex is
responsible for rational and analytical thought and language. The middle
two sections comprise the limbic brain. The limbic brain is responsible
for all of our feelings, such as trust and loyalty. It's also
responsible for all human behavior and all our decision making, but it
has no capacity for language.</p>
<p>When we communicate from the outside in, when we communicate WHAT we
do first, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated
information, like facts and features, but it does not drive behavior.
But when we communicate from the inside out, we're talking directly to
the part of the brain allows us to rationalize those decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our limbic brain is powerful, powerful enough to drive behavior that
sometimes contradicts our rational and analytical understanding of a
situation. We often trust our gut, even if the decision flies in the
face of all the facts and figures. Richard Restak, a well-known
neuroscientist, talks about this in his book, The Naked Brain. When you
force people to make decisions with only the rational part of their
brain, they almost invariably end up 'overthinking.' These rational
decisions tend to take longer to make, says Restak, and can often be of
lower quality. In contrast, decisions made with the limbic brain, gut
decisions, tend to be faster, higher-quality decisions.</p>
<p>Our limbic brains are smart and often know the right thing to do. It
is our inability to verbalize the reasons that may cause us to doubt
ourselves or trust the empirical evidence when our gut tells us not
to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. A failure to
communicate WHY creates nothing but stress or doubt.</p>
<p>Those decisions started with WHY - the emotional component of the
decision - and then the rational components allowed the buyer to
verbalize or rationalize the reasons for their decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great leaders are those who trust their gut. They are those who
understand the art before the science. They win hearts before minds.
They are the ones who start with WHY. "I can make a decision with 30
percent of the information, " said former Secretary of State Colin
Powell. "Anything more than 80 percent is too much." There is always a
level at which we trust ourselves or those around us to guide us, and
don't always feel we need all the facts and figures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our hope, dreams, hearts, and guts drive us to try new
things, not logic or facts.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we were all rational, there would be no small businesses, there
would be no exploration, there would be very little innovation and there
would be no great leaders to inspire all those things. It is the undying
belief in something bigger and better that drives that kind of
behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In reality, their purchase decision and their loyalty are deeply
personal. They don't really care about Apple; it's all about them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Products are not just symbols of what the company believes, they also
serve as symbols of what the loyal buyers believe.</p>
<p>Products with a clear sense of WHY give people a way to tell the
outside world who they are and what they believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Clarity of WHY, discipline of HOW, and Consistency of WHAT
are all needed.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask the best salesmen what it takes to be a great salesman. They will
always tell you that it helps when you really believe in the product
you're selling... When salesmen actually believe in the thing they are
selling, then the words that come out of their mouths are authentic.
When belief enters the equation, passion exudes from the salesman. It is
this authenticity that produces the relationships upon which all the
best sales organizations are based. Relationships also build trust. And
with trust comes loyalty. Absent a balanced Golden Circle means no
authenticity, which means no strong relationships, which means no trust.
And you're back at square one selling on price, service, quality or
features. You are back to being like everyone else. Worse, without that
authenticity, companies resort to manipulation: pricing, promotions,
peer pressure, fear, take your pick. Effective? Of course, but only for
the short term.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If they buy something that doesn't clearly embody their own sense of
WHY, then those around them have little evidence to paint a clear and
accurate picture of who they are. The human animal is a social animal.
We're very good at sensing subtleties in behavior and judging people
accordingly. We get good feelings and bad feelings about companies, just
as we get good feelings and bad feelings about people. There are some
people we just feel we can trust and others we just feel we can't.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Trust begins to emerge when we have a sense that the driver
of behaviors is anything but self-gain.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trust is not a checklist. Fulfilling all your responsibilities does
not create trust. Trust is a feeling, not a rational experience. We
trust some people and companies even when things go wrong, and we don't
trust others even though everything might have gone exactly as it should
have. A completed checklist does not guarantee trust. Trust begins to
emerge when we have a sense that another person or organization is
driven by things other than their own self-gain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who lead are able to do so because those who follow trust that
the decisions made at the top have the best interests of the group at
heart. In turn, those who trust work hard because they feel like they
are working for something bigger than themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When people come to work with a higher sense of purpose, they find it
easier to weather hard times or even to find opportunity in those hard
times. People who come to work with a clear sense of WHY are less prone
to giving up after a few failures because they understand the higher
cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Finding the people who believe what you believe</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do better in cultures in which we are good fits. We do better in
places that reflect our own values and beliefs. Just as the goal is not
to do business with anyone who simply wants what you have, but to do
business with people who believe what you believe, so too is it
beneficial to live and work in a place where you will naturally thrive
because your values and beliefs align with the values and beliefs of
that culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When employees belong, they will guarantee your success. And they
won't be working hard and looking for innovative solutions for you, they
will be doing it for themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As Herb Kelleher famously said, "you don't hire for skills, you hire
for attitude. You can always teach skills."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The truth is, almost every person on the planet is passionate; we are
not all passionate for the same things.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal is to hire those who are passionate for your WHY, your
purpose, cause or belief, and who have the attitude that fits your
culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great companies don't hire skilled people and motivate them; they
hire already motivated people and inspire them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If those inside the organization are a good fit, the opportunity to
"go the extra mile", to explore, to invent, to innovate, to advance, and
more importantly, to do so again and again and again, increases
dramatically. Only with mutual trust can an organization become
great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Law of Diffussion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our population is broken into five segments that fall across a bell
curve: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and
laggards.</p>
<p>Early adopters are willing to pay a premium or suffer some level of
inconvenience to own a product or espouse an idea that feels right.
Their willingness to suffer an inconvenience or pay a premium had less
to do with how great the product was and more to do with their own sense
of who they are. They wanted to be the first.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The farther right you go on the curve, the more you will encounter
the clients and customers who may need what you have, but don't
necessarily believe what you believe. As clients, they are the ones for
whom, no matter how hard you work, it's never enough. Everything usually
boils down to price with them. They are rarely loyal. They rarely give
referrals and sometimes you may even wonder out loud why you still do
business with them, "They just don't get it," our gut tells us. The
importance of identifying this group is so that you can avoid doing
business with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is an irony to mass-market success, as it turns out. It's near
impossible to achieve if you point your marketing and resources to the
middle of the bell, if you attempt to woo those who represent the middle
of the curve without first appealing to the early adopters. It can be
done, but at a massive expense. This is because the early majority,
according to Rogers, will not try something until someone else has tried
it first. The early majority, indeed the entire majority, needs the
recommendation of someone else who has already sampled the product or
service.</p>
<p>That's what a manipulation is. They may buy, but they won't be loyal.
Don't forget, loyalty is when people are willing to suffer some
inconvenience or pay a premium to do business with you. They may even
turn down a better offer from someone else - something the late majority
rarely does.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Get enough people on the left side of the curve on your side and they
encourage the rest to follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Energy excites. Charisma inspires.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charisma has nothing to do with energy; it comes from a clarity of
WHY. It comes from absolute conviction in an ideal bigger than oneself.
Energy, in contrast, comes from a good night's sleep or lots of
caffeine. Energy can excite. But only charisma can inspire. Charisma
commands loyalty. Energy does not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Golden Circle matches an organization</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sitting at the top of the system, representing the WHY, is a leader;
in the case of a company, that's usually the CEO. The next level down,
the HOW level, typically includes the senior executives who are inspired
by the leader's vision and know HOW to bring it to life. Don't forget
that a WHY is just a belief, HOWs are the actions we take to realize
that belief and WHATs are the results of those actions. No matter how
charismatic or inspiring the leader is, if there are not people in the
organization inspired to bring that vision to reality, to build an
infrastructure with systems and processes, then at best, inefficiency
reigns, and at worst, failure results.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WHY-types are focused on the things most people can't see, like the
future. HOW-types are focused on things most people can see and tend to
be better at building structures and processes and getting things
done.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people in the world are HOW-types. Most people are quite
functional in the real world and can do their jobs and do very well.
Some may be very successful and even make millions of dollars, but they
will never build billion-dollar businesses or change the world.
HOW-types don't need WHY-types to do well. Buy WHY-guys, for all their
vision and imagination, often get the short end of the stick. Without
someone inspired by their vision and the knowledge to make it a reality,
most WHY-types end up as starving visionaries, people with all the
answers but never accomplishing much themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When a company is small, it revolves around the personality of the
founder. There is no debate that the founder's personality is the
personality of the company. As a company grows, the CEO's job is to
personify the WHY. To ooze of it. To talk about it. To preach it. To be
a symbol of what the company believes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We all know when a company's WHY goes fuzzy. Split can
happen.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Wal-Mart, WHAT they do and HOW they are doing it hasn't changed.
And it has nothing to do with Wal-Mart being a 'corporation'; they were
one of those before the love started to decline. What has changed is
that their WHY went fuzzy. And we all know it. A company once so loved
is simply not as loved anymore. The negative feelings we have for the
company are real, but the part of the brain that is able to explain why
we feel so negatively toward them has trouble explaining what changed.
So we rationalize and point to the most tangible things we can see -
size and money. If we, as outsiders, have lost clarity of Wal-Mart's
WHY, it's a good sign that the WHY has gone fuzzy inside the company
also. If it's not clear on the inside, it will never be clear on the
outside. What is clear is that the Wal-Mart of today is not the Wal-Mart
that Sam Walton built.</p>
<p>It's too easy to say that all they care about is their bottom line.
All companies are in business to make money, but being successful at it
is not the reason why things change so drastically. That only points to
a symptom. Without understanding the reason it happened in the first
place, the pattern will repeat for every other company that makes it
big. It is not destiny or some mystical business cycle that transforms
successful companies into impersonal Goliaths. It's people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For most of us, somewhere in the journey, we forget WHY we set out on
the journey in the first place. Somewhere in the course of all those
achievements, an inevitable split happens.</p>
<p>Those with an ability to never lose sight of WHY, no matter how
little or how much they achieve, can inspire us. Those with the ability
to never lose sight of WHY and also achieve the milestones that keep
everyone focused in the right direction are the great leaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As this metric grows, any company can become a 'leading' company. But
it is the ability to inspire, to maintain clarity of WHY, that gives
only a few people and organizations the ability to lead. The moment at
which the clarity of WHY starts to go fuzzy is the split. At this point,
organizations may be loud, but they are no longer clear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The challenge isn't to cling to the leader, it's to find effective
ways to keep the founding vision alive forever.</p>
<p>For an organization to continue to inspire and lead beyond the
lifetime of its founder, the founder's WHY. must be extracted and
integrated into the culture of the company. What's more, a strong
succession plan should aim to find next generation. Future leaders and
employees alike must be inspired by something bigger than the force of
personality of the founder and must see beyond profit and shareholder
value alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The WHY originates from looking back</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before it can gain any power or achieve any impact, an arrow must be
pulled backward, 180 degrees away from the target. And that's also where
a WHY derives its power. The WHY does not come from looking ahead at
what you want to achieve and figuring out an appropriate strategy to get
there. It is not born out of any market research. It does not come from
extensive interviews with customers or even employees. It comes from
looking in the completely opposite direction from where you are now.
Finding WHY is a process of discovery, not invention.</p>

<p>The near-finalized framework of a deal between the U.S. and China
concerning the popular social media application TikTok, involves
creating a new U.S. entity to manage the app’s American operations, with
an investor consortium, including Oracle, taking a roughly 80%
controlling stake, which satisfies a recent U.S. law regarding foreign
ownership. A key component of the agreement is the establishment of
American control over user data and the crucial content-recommendation
algorithms, although they will be based on technology licensed from
TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Furthermore, the article
notes that President Trump has delayed the TikTok ban until December as
negotiations conclude, signaling the resolution of a multi-year national
security dispute over the app's influence in the U.S. Both Chinese and
American officials have reached a basic consensus on the terms, which
also include Oracle managing U.S. user data at its facilities in
Texas.</p>

<p>Dojo was a custom-built supercomputer intended to be the cornerstone
of Tesla's AI ambitions, specifically for training the neural networks
of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and humanoid robots.</p>
<p>The primary strategic reasons cited for the project's termination
include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the strategic pivot to AI6 chips. The AI6 chip is Tesla’s new
strategic bet on a chip design intended to scale across FSD, Tesla’s
Optimus humanoid robots, and high-performance AI training in data
centers</li>
<li>moving away from hardware self-reliance. Dojo was intended to reduce
reliance on expensive eand difficulty-to-secure Nvidia GPUs, but Tesla
is now "going all-in on partnerships" with major chip providers,
including Nvidia, AMD, and Samsung (which will build the AI6 chip)</li>
<li>technological and compatibility hurdles. Dojo’s design, based on
proprietary D1 chips, faced inherent technological challenges related to
integration with the broader AI ecosystem</li>
<li>internal competition and redundency. In August 2024, Tesla began
promoting Cortex, described as the company’s "giant new AI training
supercluster" being built at Tesla HQ in Austin. Cortex was later
deployed at Gigafactory Texas.</li>

<p><strong>A New Ranking Framework for Better Notification Quality on
Instagram - Engineering at Meta</strong> [<a

</blockquote>
<p>While existing machine learning (ML) models optimize for high
engagement, they can result in repetitive and potentially "spammy"
notifications, leading users to disable them. To combat this, the new
framework applies a multiplicative penalty to notification scores based
on their similarity to recently sent ones, using criteria such as author
and product type. This strategy has successfully reduced notification
volume while increasing engagement rates by ensuring a more varied and
personalized mix of content.</p>
<p>The methodology begins with the existing machine learning (ML)
models, which calculate a base score for notification candidates based
on factors like the probability of a user clicking (Click-Through-Rate
or CTR) and time spent. The new framework introduces a diversity layer
on top of these existing engagement ML models.</p>
<p>The methodology involves the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Evaluation of Similarity:</strong> The diversity layer
evaluates each notification candidate's similarity to recently sent
notifications across multiple dimensions, such as content, author,
notification type, and product surface.</li>
<li><strong>Application of Penalties:</strong> The system applies
carefully calibrated penalties, expressed as multiplicative demotion
factors, to downrank candidates that are too similar or repetitive to
recent notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Re-ranking:</strong> The adjusted scores (base relevance
score multiplied by the demotion factor) are used to re-rank the
candidates.</li>
<li><strong>Selection:</strong> The final selection process uses a
quality bar to choose the top-ranked candidate that successfully passes
both the ranking and diversity criteria.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within the diversity layer, the methodology is mathematically
implemented using a multiplicative demotion factor applied to the base
relevance score:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Final Score } (S(c)) = \text{Base
Ranking Score } (R(c)) \cdot \text{Diversity Demotion Multiplier }
(D(c))\]</span></p>
<p>Key aspects of this calculation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demotion Multiplier (<span
class="math inline">\(D(c)\)</span>):</strong> This is a penalty factor
where the value falls within the range of 0 to 1 (<span
class="math inline">\(D(c) \in\)</span>), reducing the score based on
similarity to recently sent notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Similarity Signal:</strong> To calculate <span
class="math inline">\(D(c)\)</span>, a similarity signal (<span
class="math inline">\(p_i(c)\)</span>) is computed for a set of semantic
dimensions (e.g., author, product type) using a maximal marginal
relevance (MMR) approach.</li>
<li><strong>Binary Baseline:</strong> In the baseline implementation,
the similarity signal <span class="math inline">\(p_i(c)\)</span> is
binary: it equals 1 if the similarity exceeds a predefined threshold
(<span class="math inline">\(\tau_i\)</span>), and 0 otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Control:</strong> The methodology defines the final
demotion multiplier using adjustable weights (<span
class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>), which control the strength of
demotion for each respective dimension.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The best roadmaps aren't checklists; they tell a story about why
something is being built. They show how short-term initiatives connect
to long-term strategic goals.</p>
<p>The <strong>Now, Next, Later Framework</strong> is a core pattern,
reflecting the reality of uncertainty. Now initiatives are tight,
concrete, and focused on current goals (e.g., MVP launch). Next
initiatives are more exploratory bets. Later initiatives are
deliberately fuzzy, long-term aspirations that signal intent without
making firm promises.</p>
<p>Effective roadmaps frame initiatives as problems to solve and tie
them to clear outcomes and business objectives (e.g., "reduce onboarding
friction" instead of "ship a new login flow"). This keeps the team
flexible and focused on results.</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all roadmap. A startup's roadmap is about
survival and proving a hypothesis. A scale-up's roadmap is about
smoothing friction and deepening engagement. A hardware roadmap must
account for manufacturing cycles, while a mission-critical one must
prioritize compliance and security.</p>

in a traditional sense. The study found that participants were able to

not retain the knowledge or skills gained after the tools were taken

workers to do more, but does not intrinsically change what they have

</blockquote>
<p>Seven Non-Obvious Strategies</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Never rely only on online submission: Avoid the "digital dustbin" by
finding an alternative path in, such as a referral, connection, or
direct reach-out.</li>
<li>Ask for advice, not a job: Sincerely seek guidance on entering a
field or company, as people are often generous and may uncover new
opportunities for you.</li>
<li>Give them a reason to say yes: Counter the process of finding
reasons to say <em>no</em> (misspellings, poor grammar) by providing
human connection points like shared alma maters, hobbies, or passions to
hack affinity bias.</li>
<li>Find the “you-shaped hole”: Seek roles where your unique skills,
experience, or passion make you the best bet, demonstrating you can "hit
the ground running on day one".</li>
<li>See the world through the hiring manager’s eyes: Hiring managers
prioritize managing risk because a bad hire is costly. Your job is to
close the asymmetry of information, prove you are a "sure bet," and show
you are a great return on investment.</li>
<li>Do the job before you get the job: Demonstrate initiative by acting
like an employee; use the product, talk to customers, and bring specific
ideas or prototypes to show you want <em>this</em> job.</li>
<li>Tailor your resume (and your story) for the role: Treat your resume
as a "living document" to tell a specific story, reframing factual
experiences to align with the target role and "speak the language of the
hiring company".</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Several clarifications mentioned in this blog:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Accuracy will never reach 100%</li>
<li>Hallucinations are not inevitable. Language models can choose to
abstain when uncertain. Abstaining (indicating uncertainty) is better
than providing confident, incorrect information, aligning with the core
value of humility</li>
<li>Avoiding hallucination can be easier for a small model to know its
limits. Being "calibrated" (knowing its confidence) requires much less
computation than being accurate</li>
<li>To measure hallucinations, all of the primary evaluation metrics
need to be reworked to reward expressions of uncertainty. Hallucination
evals have little effect against hundreds of traditional accuracy-based
evals that punish humility</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Key findings:</p>
<p>I. Adoption Speed and Shift to Delegation</p>
<ul>
<li>AI adoption is occurring at an unprecedented speed, reaching in two
years the adoption rates that took the internet around five years. In
the US, 40% of employees report using AI at work, doubling the rate from
two years prior in 2023.</li>
<li>Usage patterns on Claude.ai show a net shift toward delegation
(automation). The share of "Directive" conversations, where users
delegate complete tasks, jumped from 27% to 39%, meaning automation
usage now exceeds augmentation usage for the first time.</li>
<li>There is sustained growth in knowledge-intensive tasks like
education and science. In coding, there is a net shift of 7.4 percentage
points toward program creation and away from debugging, suggesting
models have become more reliable.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>Geographic Concentration and Inequality Risk</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>AI usage is highly geographically concentrated and correlates
strongly with income across countries. A 1% increase in GDP per
working-age capita is associated with a 0.7% increase in Claude usage
per capita.</li>
<li>Small, technologically advanced economies lead in per-capita
adoption, with Israel (7x expected usage) and Singapore (4.57x expected
usage) being top examples.</li>
<li>Low-adoption countries are more likely to delegate complete tasks
(automation), while high-adoption countries tend toward greater learning
and collaborative iteration (augmentation), even when controlling for
task mix.</li>
<li>Current usage patterns suggest that AI benefits may concentrate in
already-rich regions, potentially increasing global economic
inequality.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>Enterprise Automation and Deployment Bottlenecks</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise usage via the 1P API is predominantly
automation-dominant, with 77% of business uses involving automation
patterns (delegating tasks programmatically), compared to about 50% for
Claude.ai users.</li>
<li>Business deployment is largely price-insensitive. Model capabilities
and the economic value of automation appear to matter more than cost, as
higher-cost tasks tend to have higher usage rates.</li>
<li>For complex tasks, deployment is constrained by the access to
information rather than just model capabilities. Companies face a
bottleneck requiring costly data modernization and organizational
investments to centralize the contextual information needed for
sophisticated AI use.</li>

          <p>I read the book "<em>Never Split the Difference : Negotiating As If
Your Life Depended On It</em>" by Chris Voss a month ago and finally got
time to write some notes down. I love this type of book that provides
structured, practical suggestions for achieving a goal, backed by
academic research and theories.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">never_split_the_difference</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This book is building its argument on some well-established,
peer-reviewed psychological theories that show human decision-making is
often more emotional and irrational than we'd like to believe. Voss
grounds his approach in Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's foundational
research on behavioral economics and cognitive psychology. The specific
concepts highlighted in the book are: cognitive biases, the framing
effect, loss aversion, system 1 and system 2 thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cognitive biases: People are not purely rational actors. Instead,
our decisions are influenced by systematic, unconscious, and irrational
mental shortcuts.</li>
<li>The framing effect: People respond differently to the same choice
depending on how it's presented or "framed." For example, framing a
negotiation in terms of what the other party stands to lose is often
more powerful than framing it in terms of what they stand to gain.</li>
<li>Loss aversion: A core tenet of Prospect Theory, this principle
states that the psychological pain of a loss is roughly twice as
powerful as the pleasure of an equivalent gain.</li>
<li>System 1 and system 2 thinking: Introduced in Kahneman's book,
<em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, this model describes two distinct
modes of thought. System 1 is our fast, instinctive, and emotional mind.
System 2 is our slow, deliberate, and logical mind. Voss's techniques
are designed to bypass the logical System 2 and appeal directly to the
emotional and intuitive System 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>The central tenets of Chris Voss's effective negotiation strategy are
rooted in emotional intelligence and a shift from a competitive to a
collaborative mindset. Rather than seeking a compromise, his methods
focus on understanding the other party to influence their
decision-making. The key elements of his approach include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tactical empathy: intentionally using empathy to understand the
other person's perspective, emotions, and motivations. The goal is to
build a trust-based relationship, not necessarily to agree with
them.</li>
<li>Active learning: it's important to truly listen to what the other
person is saying, rather than just waiting for your turn to speak. This
includes paying attention to their words, tone, and body language, to
uncover their real needs and fears.</li>
<li>Calibrated questions: open-ended questions that start with 'how' or
'what', and are designed to give the other person the illusion of
control while you guide them toward a solution that benefits both
sides.</li>
<li>Key techniques:
<ul>
<li>Mirroring: repeating the last one to three key words of what the
other person has said. This encourages them to elaborate and creates a
sense of rapport.</li>
<li>Labeling: verbally identifying the acknowledging the other person's
emotions. This helps to diffuse negative emotions and makes them feel
heard.</li>
<li>The power of 'no': 'no' is not a failure but a critical starting
point. It makes the other party feel safe and in control, and it allows
you to get past insincere agreements to uncover the true issues.</li>
<li>"That's right" as the goal: Instead of aiming for "yes," the
ultimate goal is to get the other person to say, "That's right." This
phrase signifies that they feel you have accurately understood their
position and worldview, creating a turning point in the
negotiation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Other impressive key lessons to remember:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Be ready for possible surprises, and use skills to reveal the
surprises</li>
<li>View assumptions as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them
rigorously</li>
<li>Negotiation is not a battle but a process of discovery with the goal
of uncovering as much information as possible</li>
<li>Let the person be in a positive frame of mind. Positivity creates
mental agility in both you and your counterpart</li>
<li>Keep voice calm and slow. Create an aura of authority and
trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness</li>
<li>Use positive / playful voice as default. Use direct or assertive
voice rarely</li>
<li>Acknowledging the other person's situation to convey that you are
listening</li>
<li>Focus first on clearing the barriers to agreement</li>
<li>Pause and let the other party to fill in the silence</li>
<li>Label your counterpart's fears to diffuse their power and generate
safety, well-being, and trust</li>
<li>Accusation audit: List the worst things that the other party could
say about you and say them before the other person can</li>
<li>All negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires
and needs</li>
<li>Don't compromise. Meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both
sides</li>
<li>Approaching deadlines entice people to rush the negotiating process
and do impulsive things that againt their best interests</li>
<li>Before you make an offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how bad
it will be. When you get to numbers, set an extreme anchor to make your
'real' offer seem reasonable, or usse a range to seem less
aggressive.</li>
<li>People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a
gain.</li>
<li>Avoid asking questions that can be answered by 'yes'. Ask calibrated
questions that start with the words 'how' or 'what'. Avoid asking
questions starting with 'why' which is always an accusation in any
language.</li>
<li>Calibrate questions to point your counterpart toward solving your
problems.</li>
<li>There is always a team on the other side. You are vulnerable if you
don't influence those behind the table.</li>
<li>Asking 'how' question gives counterpart an illusion of control and
leads them to contemplate yoru problems when making their demand.</li>
<li>Identify the motivations of players 'behind the table'. You can do
so by asking how a deal will affect everybody else and how on board they
are.</li>
<li>Pay 38% attention to tone of voice and 55% to body language. The
rest 7% is on words.</li>
<li>Test whether 'yes' is real or counterfeit by using calibrated
questions, summaries, and labels to get your counterpart to reaffirm
their agreement at least three times.</li>
<li>Pay attention to a person's use of pronouns which offers deep
insights into his or her relative authority. If you are hearing a lot of
'I', 'me', and 'my', the real power to decide probably lies elsewhere.
Picking up a lot of 'we', 'they', and 'them', it's more likely you are
dealing directly with a savvy decision maker keeping his options
open.</li>
<li>Humor and humanity are the best ways to break the ice and remove
roadblocks.</li>
<li>Identify your counterpart's negotiation style: Accomodator,
Assertive, or Analyst.</li>
<li>Prepare dodging tactics to avoid getting sucked into the compromise
trap.</li>
<li>Learn to take a punch or punch back without anger. The guy across
the table is not the problem, the situation is.</li>
<li>Prepare an Ackerman plan:
<ol type="1">
<li>Set you target price (goal)</li>
<li>Set your first offer at 65% of your target price</li>
<li>Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85%, 95%, and
100%)</li>
<li>Use lots of empath and different ways of saying 'No' to getthe other
side to counter before you increase your offer</li>
<li>when calculating the final amount, use precise, non round numbers
like, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and
weight.</li>
<li>On your final number, throw in a non monetary item (that they
probably don't want) to show you are at your limit.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Black swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the three types of
leverages: positive (the ability to give someone what they want);
negative (the ability to hurt someone); and normative (using your
counterpart's norms to bring them around).</li>
<li>Understand the other side's 'religion / worldview' (reason for
being) so that we are able to speak persuasively, develop options that
resonate for them, and build influence. Black swan usually dwells in the
hidden negotiation space.</li>
<li>People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural
similarity with.</li>
<li>Get face time with the counterpart.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Selected Quotes</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What good negotiators do when labeling is to address those underlying
emotions. Labeling negatives diffuses them (or defuses them, in extreme
cases); labeling positives reinforces them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great negotiators seek 'No' because they know that's often when the
real negotiation begins.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether you call it "buy-in" or 'engagement' or something else, good
negotiators know that their job isn't to put on a great performance but
to gently guide their counterpart to discover their goal as his own.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never split the difference. Creative solutions are almost always
preceded by some degree of risk, annoyance, confusion, and conflict.
Accommodation and compromise produce none of that. You've got to embrace
the hard stuff. That's where the great deals are. And that's what great
negotiators do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can get the other party to reveal their problems, pain, and
unmet objectives - if you can get at what people are really buying -
then you can sell them a vision of their problem that leaves your
proposal as the perfect solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are selling yourself to a manager, sell yourself as more
than a body for a job; sell yourself, and your success, as a way they
can validate their own intelligence and broadcast it to the rest of the
company. Make sure they know you'll act as a flesh-and-blood argument
for their importance.</p>
<p>The key issue here is if someone gives you guidance, they will watch
you to see if you follow their advice. They will have a personal stake
in seeing you succeed. You've just recruited your first unofficial
mentor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Negotiation was coaxing, not overcoming; co-opting, not defeating.
Most importantly, successful negotiation involved getting your
counterpart to do the work for you and suggest your solution himself. It
involved giving him the illusion of control while you, in fact, were the
one defining the conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking for help in this manner (give illusion of control by asking
calibrated questions), after you've already been engaged ina dialogue,
is an incredibly powerful negotiating technique for transforming
encounters from confrontational showdowns into joint problem-solving
sessions. And calibrated questions are the best tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Expression of anger increase a negotiator's advantage and final take.
Anger shows passion and conviction that can help sway the other side to
accept less. However, by heightening your counterpart's sensitivity to
danger and fear, your anger reduces the resources they have for other
cognitive activity, setting them up to make bad concessions that will
likely lead to implementation problems, thus reducing your gains.</p>
<p>Also beware: researchers have also found that disingenuous
expressions of unfelt anger - faking it - backfire, leading to
inractable demadns and destroying trust. For anger to be effective, it
has to be real, the key for it is to be under control because anger also
reduces our cognitive ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No deal is better than a bad deal. Once you're clear on what you
bottom line s, you have to be willing to walk away. Never be needy for a
deal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of punching back and boundary-setting tactics as a flattened
S-curve: you've accelerated up the slope of a negotiation and hit a
plateau that requires you to temporarily stop any progress, escalate or
de-escalate the issue acting as the obstable, and eventually bring the
relationship backto a state of rapport and get back on the slope. Taking
a positive, constructive approach to conflict involves understanding
that the bond is fundamental to any resolution. Never create an
enemy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By positioning your demands within the worldview your conuterpart
uses to make decisions, you show them respect and that gets your
attention and results. Knowing your counterpart's religion is more than
just gaining normative leverage per se. Rather, it's gaining a holistic
understanding of your counterpart's worldview and using that knowledge
to inform your negotiating moves.</p>
<p>Two tips for reading religion correctly:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Review everything you hear</li>
<li>Use backup listeners whose only job is to listen between the lines.
They will hear things you miss.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you recognize that your counterpart is not irrational, but
simply ill-informed, constrained, or obeying interests that you do not
yet know, your field of movement greatly expands. And that allows you to
negotiate much more effectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Art of 'No':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saying "No" gives the speaker the feeling of safety, security, and
control. You use a question that prompts a "No" answer, and your
counterpart feels that by turningyou down hehas proved that he's in the
driver's seat. Good negotiators welcome - even invite - a solid "No" to
start, as a sign that the other party is engaged and thinking.</p>
<p>Gun for a "Yes" straight off the bat, though, and your counterpart
gets defensive, wary,and skittish. That's why I tell my students that,
if you are trying to sell something, don't start with "Doyou have a few
minutes to talk?" Instead ask, "Is now a bad time to talk?" Either you
get "Yes, it's a bad time" followed by a good time or a request to go
away, or you get "No, it's not" and total focus.</p>
<p>It's a reaffirmation of autonomy. It is not a use or abuse of power;
it is not an act of rejection; it is not a manifestation of
stubbornness; it is not the end of the negotiation.</p>
<p>"No" has a lot of skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>"No" allows the real issues to be brought forth</li>
<li>"No" protects people from making - and lets them correct -
ineffective decisions</li>
<li>"No" slows things down so that people can freely embrace their
decisions and the agreements they enter into</li>
<li>"No" helps people feel safe, secure, emotionally comfortable, and in
control of their decisions</li>
<li>"No" moves everyone's efforts forward</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a big difference between making your counterpart feel that
they can say "No" and actually getting them to say it. Sometimes, if you
are talking to somebody who is just not listening, the only way you can
crack their cranium is to antagonize them into "No".</p>
<p>One great way to do this is to mislabel one of the other party's
emotions or desires. You say something that you know is totally wrong.
That forces them to listen and makes them comfortable correcting
you.</p>
<p>Another way to force "No" in a negotiation is to ask the other party
what they don't want. People are comfortable saying "No" here because it
feels like self-protection. And once you've gotten them to say "No",
people are much more open to moving forward toward new options and
ideas.</p>

<p>AI psychosis - users develop delusions or distorted beliefs after
extensive use of chatbots like ChatGPT. Those with a personal or family

chatbots as tools, not friends, and to avoid relying on them for
emotional support. They recommend that companies collect more data, work
with mental health professionals, and build safeguards directly into
their models, such as prompting users to take breaks or issuing "warning

<p><em>A key part of being a lifelong learner is retaining what you are

lives.</em></p>
<p><em>I choose a certain number of topics/books that I want to
read/learn each year and focus on reading those books
deliberately.</em></p>
<p><em>I find reading to be a more positive habit than scrolling
mindlessly on my phone or watching YouTube videos. I do those things as
well but I try to change my habits by choosing books instead. I also
read multiple books at a time. This helps me avoid feeling the dread of
picking up a challenging or long book when I am tired after a long
day.</em></p>
<p><em>I have tried different retention techniques over the years, and
have found these to work best for me. At first, these were slower and
felt less efficient, but I have gotten faster and better at utilizing
these tips with practice.</em></p>

Deeply</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ryandhall.substack.com/p/how-to-remember-what-you-read">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ryan Hall's top five tips for retaining more of what you are
reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Underline or highlight key ideas or phrases</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When reading deeply, always have a pen or highlighter in hand.</li>
<li>On the first read-through, underline or highlight any key concepts,
ideas, characters, or quotes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This practice makes the reader interactive with the text and enables
quick review of key concepts after reading. Reviewing these key ideas
after finishing a chapter is helpful and increases focus as you actively
look for points to underline.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Write in books</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>As you read and underline, write notes in the margins. These notes
can include key ideas, questions, or indications if you don't understand
a section or disagree with something.</li>
<li>Notes are often single words or short phrases, like "Habit Stacking"
when reading <em>Atomic Habits</em>. These words stand out when you
revisit a section or chapter, keeping your mind engaged.</li>
<li>For digital readers (like on a Kindle), keep a notes app open on
your phone to jot down words or phrases related to the chapter. (A
separate source comment also notes that Kindles allow unlimited marginal
notes without needing a separate app).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Briefly summarize each section or chapter immediately
after you have read it</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a notebook for reading notes, where you can write the date,
book title, and chapter. Highlighting different books with different
colors can help distinguish ideas from various books.</li>
<li>Immediately after finishing a chapter or section, briefly summarize
it in your own words, keeping it short (1-3 sentences). Putting ideas
into your own words helps formulate thoughts and allows you to test your
understanding of the concepts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Talk to others or teach someone else</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell someone else about what you are reading and learning. This
verbal processing forces your mind to recall what you have read and put
the pieces together, leading to greater retention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Write reviews or summaries</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>After finishing a book, write a review or a summary. It doesn't need
to be elaborate; the goal is to start the process of putting thoughts on
paper or keyboard to let your mind work through what you've learned. Try
to recall key plot points, ideas, and quotes, referencing your notebook
notes and margin annotations.</li>
<li>Summarize what you've read and ideas you'd like to incorporate into
your life. For nonfiction, try to apply one idea into your life. Another
comment also suggests writing a summary paragraph of each chapter and
then summarizing those in a review.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, bonus tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Re-read classic or deeper non-fiction books</strong>, as
they are often meant to be revisited and "wrestled with".</li>
<li><strong>Listen to podcasts or interviews with the author</strong>
(especially for nonfiction) after reading the book, as authors may
provide more context or better explanations in an interview format.</li>

<p><strong>Write Everything Down (and not in your notes app) - Megan,
Typewriter Time</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://moooshh.substack.com/p/write-everything-down-and-not-in">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author found that digital notes were easily forgotten and lacked
the tangible connection and memory associated with handwriting. By
shifting to a dedicated creative writing notebook, the author
experienced improved recall, a more thoughtful writing process, and a
stronger connection to their ideas and progress. The piece advocates for
the benefits of physical writing for creative endeavors and personal
reflection, highlighting how it fosters a deeper engagement with one's
own thoughts and creations, a sentiment echoed by the included
comments.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to handwriting everything in notebooks instead of using your
phone.</li>
<li>Use a dedicated notebook for creative writing only.</li>
<li>Write down ideas and pieces by hand.</li>
<li>Constantly flip back through the pages of your physical
notebook.</li>
<li>Write out observations about your growth and areas for improvement
directly within the same notebook.</li>
<li>Create an index in your notebook so you can find things easily.</li>
<li>Tab pages of importance.</li>
<li>Scratch out things when you're stuck or frustrated. This allows for
a "messy and alive" notebook that reflects the organic nature of the
creative process, unlike the clean digital interface.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Context engineering components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systemic Approach:</strong> It's a system, not a one-off
prompt, where the final prompt is woven together programmatically from
multiple components (e.g., role instruction, user query, fetched data,
examples).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic and Situation-Specific:</strong> Context assembly
happens per request, adapting to the query or conversation state. This
involves including different information depending on the situation,
such as a summary of a multi-turn conversation or a relevant excerpt
from a document.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Blending Multiple Content Types:</strong> It covers
instructional context (prompts, guidance, examples), knowledge context
(domain information, facts via retrieval), and tools context
(information from tool outputs like web searches or database
queries).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Format and Clarity:</strong> It's about <em>how</em>
information is presented, not just <em>what</em> is included. This means
compressing and structuring information for the model's comprehension,
using formatting like bullet points, headings, JSON, or pseudo-code, and
labeling sections (e.g., "Relevant documentation:").</li>

<li>"skill acquisition = technique stacking." Instead of trying to learn
an entire skill (like playing the guitar or Photoshop), you should focus
on specific techniques needed for a direct purpose.</li>
<li>"pure focus" as the missing ingredient for rapid learning. To
achieve this, he suggests "tactical stress" – putting yourself in a
high-pressure situation with a strong deadline that forces you to learn
quickly to avoid negative consequences. This pain of the current
situation outweighs the pain of learning, propelling you forward.</li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Suggestions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mimic others, especially those better than you.</li>
<li>Simulate the thinking of experts: Even without direct observation of
someone's thoughts, you can improve by asking yourself "what would a
better [chess player/person/etc.] do?"</li>
<li>Mimic generally competent individuals for new tasks</li>
<li>Ignore existing standards and aspire to a higher level: Recognize
that many skills are "pre-competitive," meaning current standards don't
reflect the full potential. Aim to be better than anyone you've ever
seen, rather than just slightly better than those around you. This
involves a commitment to rigorous effort and exploration beyond
perceived limits.</li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Techniques to maintain the creative state</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ritualistic work habits: Establishing consistent routines for
creative work (e.g., daily writing sessions at a specific time and
place) can induce a state akin to self-hypnosis, fostering a
non-judgmental zone.</li>
<li>Delaying exposure: Introducing a long delay between creation and
public presentation can reduce self-censorship, as the creator feels
detached from immediate judgment.</li>
<li>Viewing work in religious terms: Framing the creative process as a
service to a higher power can provide the necessary awe and daring to
push into the unknown.</li>
<li>Strategic collaboration: Working with supportive, open-minded
collaborators who challenge rather than conform can be beneficial.</li>
<li>Subverting expectations: Actively seeking out ideas or approaches
that feel slightly uncomfortable or that one might be "ashamed of
liking" can lead to truly original work.</li>
<li>Working at speed: Forcing oneself to produce work rapidly can bypass
self-censorship and allow raw, unfiltered ideas to emerge.</li>

<p><strong>Where do Tech Returns Come From? - Eric Flaningam, Generative
Value</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.generativevalue.com/p/where-do-tech-returns-come-from">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article suggests that successful technology investing requires
embracing uncertainty, understanding the "base rates" of different
company categories, recognizing where true differentiation lies (often
beyond just technology), viewing market size from a first-principles
perspective, and being aware of the unique opportunities unlocked by new
technology waves.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The next <span class="math inline">\(\$100B\)</span> company
will not look like the last:</strong> Value in technology is driven by
"anomalous" companies founded by "anomalous" people, making pattern
matching ineffective. The most successful companies create new
categories.</li>
<li><strong>Know the game you’re playing:</strong> Different categories
have different "Slugging Ratios" (Value/Company). Consumer companies,
often network-driven marketplaces with winner-take-all dynamics, have
the highest upside, while Hardtech companies also have high slugging
ratios but are riskier. Enterprise software, while less "Power Lawed,"
offers more predictable returns and is suitable for an expanding venture
capital landscape due to its scalability, moats, and lower operating
costs.</li>
<li><strong>Software is like chicken, 80% of it tastes the
same:</strong> Technical differentiation in enterprise software is often
nuanced. Sales, marketing, and building "mindshare" are as, if not more,
important than technical moats, especially as software becomes easier to
build and features are quickly replicated. The "GPT Wrapper" argument
for AI applications is analogous to how many successful enterprise
software companies were essentially "database wrappers."</li>
<li><strong>“Market size” may be the single greatest reason for
investors missing great companies:</strong> Humans struggle with
uncertainty, and new markets introduce exactly that. Many successful
companies like Palantir, Shopify, and Uber created new markets that
didn't exist before, leading to investors underestimating their
potential market size. Companies with "multiple-expansion tailwinds" and
strong platforms also tend to be underestimated.</li>
<li><strong>Companies resemble the technology waves they ride in
on:</strong> New technology waves (internet, mobile, cloud, AI) unlock
the ability for new businesses to exist. AI, for example, is enabling
anyone to create software and automate voice/text-based workflows,
expanding the market significantly and allowing for the creation of
entirely new categories (e.g., legal software companies like Harvey
reaching <span class="math inline">\(\$5B\)</span>+ valuations
quickly).</li>
<li><strong>Don't underestimate the Power Law, ever:</strong> While
mentioned throughout, this point emphasizes the extreme concentration of
value in a very small number of companies. The article states that the
top seven companies in its dataset accounted for nearly 50% of the <span
class="math inline">\(\$13\)</span> trillion in value creation.</li>

<p><strong>The Great Mental Models: Visual Book Summary -
DoubleThink</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dblthink.substack.com/p/the-great-mental-models-visual-book">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Map is Not The Territory:</strong> This model highlights
that maps (including mental models) simplify reality and are imperfect
reductions of what they represent. While useful, they lack perfect
fidelity and should be used carefully, as the real world is complex.</p>
<p><strong>Circle of Competence:</strong> Emphasizes the importance of
knowing what you know and, critically, what you don't know. It's
dangerous to incorrectly assume knowledge. The advice is to operate
within your area of expertise and outsource the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Falsifiability:</strong> States that for a theory to be
confirmed, it must be challengeable. Instead of trying to prove a theory
correct, one should try to prove it incorrect. A theory becomes stronger
when rigorous experimentation fails to disprove it.</p>
<p><strong>First Principles Thinking:</strong> Involves breaking down a
problem into its fundamental, non-reducible parts to challenge
pre-existing assumptions. It's an effective way to clarify and approach
complex problems by building solutions from the bottom up, often using
techniques like Socratic Questioning and the Five Whys.</p>
<p><strong>Thought Experiment:</strong> Refers to mentally simulating
situations to test theories or reach conclusions, rather than conducting
physical experiments. It allows for gaining confidence in answers, as
illustrated by comparing hypothetical basketball games.</p>
<p><strong>Necessity and Sufficiency:</strong> Explains that having all
necessary conditions does not guarantee all sufficient conditions are
met. Meeting necessary conditions might make success possible, but it
doesn't assure it (e.g., knowing how to write vs. being a New York Times
Bestseller).</p>
<p><strong>Second-Order Thinking:</strong> Encourages looking beyond
immediate consequences to consider the "consequence of the consequence"
or further. It involves thinking several steps ahead to avoid short-term
positive decisions that lead to long-term negative effects.</p>
<p><strong>Probabilistic Thinking</strong>: Acknowledges that the future
cannot be predicted perfectly, but this model helps improve the accuracy
of guesses using three main concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bayesian Thinking:</strong> Using all relevant prior
information for informed decisions in unfamiliar scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Fat-Tailed Curves:</strong> Understanding that the more
extreme scenarios are possible, the higher the likelihood of any one of
them occurring.</li>
<li><strong>Asymmetries:</strong> Assessing the probability that your
estimates accurately reflect the real world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correlation vs. Causation:</strong> Highlights that a
correlation between two things does not necessarily mean one causes the
other. Large datasets can yield strong correlations purely by chance, as
demonstrated by the unrelated alignment of Walgreens customer
satisfaction and Russell Crowe's movie appearances.</p>
<p><strong>Inversion Principle:</strong> A thinking tool that involves
approaching a situation from the opposite end of the usual starting
point to reframe a problem into a solution (e.g., "make money" becomes
"avoid going into debt").</p>
<p><strong>Hanlon’s Razor:</strong> Suggests that one should "never
attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by
stupidity." It implies that actions that seem ill-intended are often
accidents or misunderstandings, and the explanation assuming the least
intent is most likely correct.</p>
<p><strong>Occam’s Razor:</strong> States that when multiple
explanations are possible, the one that makes the fewest assumptions is
generally the most probable and closest to the truth. In essence, the
simplest explanation is usually the correct one.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On the <strong>EV Landscape</strong> (specifically Tesla's automotive
business):</p>
<ul>
<li>The author highlights that Tesla's year is going "from bad to
worse". Global deliveries have fallen by 13%, marking their steepest
quarterly drop ever.</li>
<li>Tesla's revenue is declining, margins are compressing, and cash flow
has dried out. Automotive revenue specifically fell by 16%
year-over-year. The author notes that "Q2 results remain very poor" if
Tesla is viewed purely as an auto business.</li>
<li>Historically strong margins, supported by gigafactory scale,
direct-to-consumer sales, and minimal marketing costs, are now being
eroded by price cuts and rising competition.</li>
<li>A return to growth, which was predicted earlier in the year, now
"looks unlikely". The company has also withheld full-year guidance due
to factors like trade policy and political backlash, adding to the
uncertainty.</li>
<li>The author expresses concern about "mounting evidence of brand
erosion".</li>
</ul>
<p>On the <strong>AV Landscape</strong> (specifically Tesla's Robotaxi
program):</p>
<ul>
<li>The author acknowledges that Tesla's robotaxi program "could unlock
tremendous value". Elon Musk himself emphasizes that "autonomy is the
story" for Tesla.</li>
<li>Despite its significant potential, the author cautions that even if
these "moonshots in robotaxi and robotics succeed," they are "years away
from offsetting collapsing vehicle demand". This indicates that the
robotaxi program is not seen as an immediate solution to Tesla's current
financial woes in its automotive segment.</li>
<li>The robotaxi program faces considerable regulatory hurdles.</li>
<li>The author raises a critical question about whether the ongoing
"brand erosion" could "undermine even the most ambitious upside" of the
robotaxi program.</li>
<li>The author foresees an "upcoming robotaxi war" among Big Tech
companies, suggesting a highly competitive environment for autonomous
vehicles.</li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Figma's Current State and Potential:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The author asserts that Figma is "not just a great product—it’s a
great business" and describes its growth since monetizing in 2017 as
"one of the most explosive runs in SaaS history".</li>
<li>Figma achieved <strong>$ $749$ million in FY24 revenue, up 48%
year-over-year</strong>, with <strong>over 1,000 customers paying <span
class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span>K+ annually</strong>, and
<strong>95% of Fortune 500 companies using Figma</strong>. The author
considers its product-led, freemium "Land and Expand" growth model to be
"hard to manufacture—and even harder to replicate".</li>
<li>The author highlights Figma's transformation "from a design tool
into a full-stack product platform". It is "evolving into a full product
development suite", with new tools like FigJam, Dev Mode, and Figma Make
(AI-driven prototyping) expanding its reach across the entire product
lifecycle.</li>
<li>Figma is positioned as a "productivity platform disguised as a
design tool", which, in the author's view, separates it "from legacy
tools and what opens the door to much broader enterprise budgets" by
serving designers, engineers, product managers, marketers, and
executives.</li>
<li>Figma's "web-first" and "multiplayer by default" approach gave it a
"distinct edge over incumbents like Adobe".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Figma's Uncertainty and Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The author notes the <strong>collapse of the <span
class="math inline">\(\$20\)</span> billion Adobe acquisition due to
"antitrust concerns in the US, UK, and Europe"</strong>. While Figma
received a "<span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> billion breakup
fee" and regained independence, this past scrutiny highlights a
challenging regulatory environment that companies of Figma's scale can
face.</li>
<li>The author points out a significant "catch" in Figma's reported net
dollar retention of 132% in Q1 FY25. They state that the metric "only
includes customers still spending over <span
class="math inline">\(\$10,000\)</span> today, then looks back at what
those same customers were spending a year ago." This indicates a
potential lack of clarity or transparency in how a key growth metric is
presented, which could be an uncertainty for investors trying to assess
actual customer retention.</li>

<p>Karen Hao, an expert in mechanical engineering and journalism,
provides a comprehensive critique of the A industry, detailing her
opinions, arguments, and proposals across various topics during the
interview.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Understanding AI and its Definition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao argues that the term "artificial intelligence" is poorly defined
and was originally coined in 1956 by John McCarthy to attract more
attention and funding for his research, essentially as a marketing term.
She notes that while AI generally refers to recreating human
intelligence in computers, there is no scientific consensus on what
human intelligence is, contributing to the term's ambiguity.</li>
<li>AI serves as an "umbrella" term encompassing various technologies
that simulate human behaviors or tasks, ranging from Siri to ChatGPT,
which operate on vastly different scales and have different use cases.
Hao uses the analogy that AI is like the word "transportation" to
illustrate its vagueness: just as "transportation" can refer to bicycles
or rockets, AI can refer to vastly different technologies with different
purposes and costs. She finds it frustrating and unproductive when
politicians use the term vaguely, suggesting it means "progress" without
specifying the type of AI or its potential costs, which she compares to
promoting rockets for commuting when more efficient alternatives
exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Environmental and Public Health Costs of AI
Development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao emphasizes that the resource consumption required to develop and
use generative AI models is quite extraordinary. She cites a McKinsey
report projecting that within the next five years, current data center
and supercomputer expansion for AI will require adding around half to
1.2 times the amount of energy consumed in the UK annually to the global
grid. A significant portion of this energy will be serviced by fossil
fuels, including natural gas and the extended lives of coal plants.</li>
<li>Hao highlights that this acceleration not only impacts the climate
crisis but also exacerbates public health crises, citing Elon Musk's
xAI's Colossus in Memphis, Tennessee, which is powered by 35 unlicensed
methane gas turbines pumping toxic air pollutants into the community.
She argues that "unlicensed" means the company completely ignored
existing environmental regulations.</li>
<li>She stresses the undertalked about issue of water consumption: AI
data centers require fresh, potable water for cooling to prevent
corrosion and bacterial growth, often using public drinking water
infrastructure. She notes that two-thirds of new AI data centers are
being built in water-scarce areas, providing the example of Montevideo,
Uruguay, where Google proposed a data center during a historic
drought.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Business Case and Ideology Driving AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao contends that the business case for AI is currently unclear,
noting that even Microsoft has started pulling back investments in data
centers and its CEO, Satya Nadella, has expressed skepticism about the
"race to AGI". She argues that what drives the fervor in the absence of
a clear business case is an ideology or a "quasi-religious fervor".
People genuinely believe in the ability to fundamentally recreate human
intelligence, seeing it as the most important civilizational goal.</li>
<li>She explains that this ideological drive from startups like OpenAI
and Anthropic pressures larger, more traditional tech giants to invest
heavily, as shareholders demand an AI strategy, often due to consumer
shifts (like using ChatGPT as search). Hao explains that OpenAI's pitch
to investors is that funding could lead to being the first to AGI for
"the biggest returns you've ever seen" or, failing that, could automate
human tasks to replace labor, generating significant returns.</li>
<li>She warns of a "bandwagon mentality" among investors. Crucially, she
highlights that if the AI bubble pops, the risk is not just for Silicon
Valley but will have ripple effects across the global economy, as
investments often come from public endowments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>OpenAI's Origins and Sam Altman's Leadership</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao reveals that OpenAI started as a nonprofit in late 2015,
co-founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman, as an "anti-Google" initiative
to conduct fundamental AI research without commercial pressures. Musk
specifically feared Google's DeepMind could lead to AI going "very badly
wrong" (sentience, harming humans). The original "open" in OpenAI stood
for open source, and for its first year, the company genuinely
open-sourced its code and research. Hao speculates that the nonprofit
status was a recruitment tool to attract talent, as they couldn't
compete with Google's salaries but could offer a compelling sense of
mission. However, within less than a year, the bottleneck shifted from
talent to capital, leading to the decision to convert to a for-profit
entity. This shift also led to a falling out between Musk and Altman
over who would be CEO.</li>
<li>Regarding Sam Altman, Hao portrays him as a "master manipulator" and
"understander of human psychology". She notes that Altman was not
publicly well-known but was a critical "lynchpin" within the tech
industry, having cultivated relationships with powerful networks and
policymakers early in his career as president of Y Combinator. Hao
states that people who worked with Altman consistently told her they
didn't know what he truly believed because he would often say he
believed what the person he was talking to believed, even if those
beliefs were diametrically opposed. She concludes that Altman's
comparative advantages as a leader include his ability to persuade
people to join his "quest," acquire necessary resources (capital, land,
energy, water, laws), and instill a powerful sense of belief in his
vision among his team. She describes his work as being most effective in
one-on-one meetings where he can tailor his message to achieve his
goals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Critique of Big Tech as a Corporate Empire</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao argues that if allowed to expand unfettered, these corporate
empires will ultimately erode democracy. Hao states that tech leaders
view the rest of the world, including other Western countries, as
"resources"—territories from which to acquire land, labor, minerals,
energy, and water for their data centers. She highlights that data
center expansion often targets economically vulnerable communities in
rural areas of the US and UK, which are often uninformed about the true
costs, such as bans on new housing construction due to massive
electricity consumption, or the depletion of fresh water supplies. Hao
laments that politicians are often unaware of these negative
consequences.</li>
<li>She argues that the idea that "you need colossal data centers to
build AI systems" is a "false trade-off". Before OpenAI, AI research was
trending towards "tiny AI systems" requiring little computational
resources, showing that AI innovation can occur without these massive,
resource-intensive approaches. Hao points out that most AI experts today
are employed by these companies, which she likens to climate scientists
being bankrolled by oil and gas companies, leading to biased information
that serves the company's interests rather than scientific
grounding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Exploitative Labor Practices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao exposes grueling exploitative practices in the global AI supply
chain, particularly regarding content moderation for OpenAI. Kenyan
workers were contracted to sift through "reams of the worst text on the
internet," including child sexual abuse, hate speech, and violent
content, to build content moderation filters for ChatGPT. She details
how this work traumatized workers, causing PTSD, personality changes,
and family breakdowns, like the story of Moffat, whose family left him
due to his changed demeanor. These workers were paid only a few dollars
an hour.</li>
<li>She also discusses data annotation, a long-standing part of the AI
industry. Venezuelan refugees in Colombia, highly educated but desperate
due to their country's economic crisis, became cheap labor for labeling
data for self-driving cars and retail platforms. Hao describes the
structural exploitation where workers compete for tasks on platforms,
leading to immense anxiety and control over their lives, exemplified by
a woman who wouldn't walk outside during weekdays for fear of missing
tasks and would wake up at 3 AM if an alarm signaled a new task. She
asserts that there is no moral justification for why these workers,
whose contributions are critical, are paid pennies while company
insiders receive multi-million dollar compensation packages; the only
"justification" is an ideological one that some people are
superior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Proposals for Public Action and Shaping the Future of
AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hao believes that anyone in the world can take action to shape the
AI development trajectory. She proposes thinking of AI development as a
"full supply chain of AI development", where various resources (data,
land, energy, water) and deployment spaces (schools, hospitals, offices)
are points of democratic contestation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>She suggests the public can reclaim ownership over resources. She
encourages people to contest the spaces where AI is deployed. Hao also
advises people to research AI technologies and vendors to make informed
choices about which AI systems to use.</p></li>
<li><p>She expresses optimism that widespread, democratic contestation
at every stage of the AI development and deployment pipeline can
"reverse the imperial conquest of these companies" and lead to a more
broadly beneficial trajectory for AI.</p></li>

<p>I finished reading Peter Thiel's '<em>Zero to One: Notes on Startups,
or How to Build the Future</em>' today. With the rapid advancements and
widespread discussion around AI, the core arguments about technology,
human-machine collaboration, and the nature of progress hold up
remarkably well. And in some ways, as a manifesto for building a better
future, what's written in this book is even more relevant now.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2 Party Like It's 1999</strong> outlines four lessons
learned from the dot-com crash that became 'dogma' in the startup world,
however, Thiel argues that these dogmas are largely incorrect and that
the opposite principles are probably more correct:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Make incremental advances:</strong> Grand visions were
seen as bubble-inflating, so small, incremental steps became the
preferred path.</p>
<p>Thiel: It is better to risk boldness than triviality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stay lean and flexible:</strong> Planning was deemed
arrogant, and "agnostic experimentation" became the norm.</p>
<p>Thiel: A bad plan is better than no plan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improve on the competition:</strong> Focus on existing
customers and recognizable products, improving on what competitors
already offer.</p>
<p>Thiel: Competitive markets destroy profits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus on product, not sales:</strong> If a product
requires advertising or salespeople, it's not good enough; viral growth
is the only sustainable growth.</p>
<p>Thiel: Sales matters just as much as product.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd, but to
think for yourself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this end this chapter, Thiel is challenging the reader to not
simply adopt the prevailing "lessons learned" from the past, but to
critically evaluate them. He suggests that true contrarianism isn't just
about disagreeing with the majority for the sake of it, but about
independent thought and forming your own conclusions, even if those
conclusions align with or contradict the crowd. It's about genuine
intellectual autonomy.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chapter 3 All Happy Companies Are Different</strong>, he
argues that successful companies are unique and that true value comes
from creating a monopoly rather than competing in existing markets.
Thiel uses the economic models of "perfect competition" and "monopoly"
to explain this difference. In perfect competition, firms sell identical
products, have no market power, and thus, in the long run, make no
economic profit as new entrants drive prices down. A monopoly,
conversely, owns its market, allowing it to set prices and maximize
profits due to a lack of close substitutes. He asserts that competition
is destructive, leading to a ruthless struggle for survival and zero
profits. Monopolies, on the other hand, can afford to focus on long-term
innovation, employee well-being, and broader societal impact because
they are not constantly battling for survival. Creative monopolies are
powerful engines for progress as they introduce entirely new categories
of abundance to the world.</p>
<p>He then discusses how both monopolists and non-monopolists tend to
misrepresent their market conditions. Monopolists (like Google) downplay
their dominance by broadly defining their market to avoid scrutiny,
while non-monopolists (like a new restaurant owner) narrowly define
their market to appear unique and avoid acknowledging intense
competition. Thiel emphasizes that losing sight of competitive reality
by focusing on trivial differentiators is a fatal mistake for
startups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by
solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed
to escape competition."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the core message from the book. Entrepreneurs should strive
to build unique, monopolistic businesses by creating something entirely
new.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 primarily focuses on the economic and strategic advantages
of monopoly and the destructive nature of perfect competition.
<strong>Chapter 4: "The Ideology of Competition"</strong> shifts the
focus to the societal and psychological impact of competition.
Competition is not merely an economic concept but a deeply ingrained
"ideology" that pervades our society, from education to personal
aspirations. He reminds readers that this competition can blind people
to real opportunities and lead to irrational behavior and missed
chances, and suggests us to recognize and resist the pervasive ideology
of competition.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5 Last Mover Advantage</strong> discusses how a great
business is defined by its ability to generate future cash flows and
argues that being a last mover (i.e., to make the last great development
in a market and enjoy long-term monopoly profits) is more advantageous
than being a first mover. It outlines four characteristics of monopoly
that contribute to a company's durability:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Proprietary Technology:</strong> This makes a product
difficult to replicate, ideally being at least 10 times better than its
closest substitute (e.g., Google's search algorithms, PayPal's payment
system for eBay, Amazon's book selection, Apple's integrated
design).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Effects:</strong> The product becomes more
valuable as more people use it (e.g., Facebook). Thiel emphasizes that
such businesses must start with a very small, focused market to get
initial users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economies of Scale:</strong> Fixed costs can be spread
over increasing sales, making the business stronger as it grows.
Software companies are particularly suited for this due to near-zero
marginal costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Branding:</strong> A strong brand creates a monopoly
(e.g., Apple). However, branding needs to be built on substantive
advantages, not just surface-level polish.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"You've probably heard about 'first mover advantage': if you're the
first entrant into a market, you can capture significant market share
while competitors scramble to get started. But moving first is a tactic,
not a goal. What really matters is generating cash flows in the future,
so being the first mover doesn't do you any good if someone else comes
along and unseats you. It's much better to be the last mover— that is,
to make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years
or even decades of monopoly profits. The way to do that is to dominate a
small niche and scale up from there, toward your ambitious long-term
vision. In this one particular at least, business is like chess.
Grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca put it well: to succeed, 'you must
study the endgame before everything else.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thiel's advice for startups (1) start small and monopolize, 2) scale
up gradually, and 3) don't discrupt) reminds me of Google's AI strategy
in recent two years, which seems to align with the 'last mover
advantage' mentality. Instead of trying to release one massive,
all-encompassing AI that competes directly with established players
across every front, Google has released or integrated AI into many
"smaller" applications or features (workspace, photos, maps, gemini,
etc). Each of these can be seen as a "small market" or specific use case
where AI offers a distinct advantage, allowing Google to "monopolize"
that particular user experience. After establishing AI capabilities in
focused areas, they are integrating these more broadly. Successful AI
features in Workspace might then be leveraged for enterprise solutions.
Advancements in image recognition from Photos could be applied to
broader visual search or other AI models. The iterative development of
Bard/Gemini, starting as a conversational AI and gradually expanding its
capabilities (multimodality, coding, planning), is a clear example of
scaling up. They build upon established user bases and technological
strengths. While Google is certainly competing, their strategy doesn't
always seem to be about a direct, disruptive frontal assault that
immediately aims to destroy an incumbent. Instead, it's often about: 1)
leveraging their exsiting ecosystem, 2) focusing on unique capabilities,
3) creating new user behaviors.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chapter 6 You Are Not a Lottery Ticket</strong>, Thiel
described the concept of definite vs. indefinite futures and asserts
that the prevailing indefinite optimism, particularly in the US, is
unsustainable. He argues that real progress and success require definite
plans and individual effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When Baby Boomers grow up and write books to explain why one or
another individual is successful, they point to the power of a
particular individual's context as determined by chance. But they miss
the even bigger social context for their own preferred explanations: a
whole generation learned from childhood to overrate the power of chance
and underrate the importance of planning."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The core of <strong>Chapter 7 Follow the Money</strong> applies the
power law to venture capital (VC). Venture returns are not normally
distributed (where most companies perform average). Instead, they follow
a power law: a small handful of companies radically outperform all
others, often returning more than the entire rest of the fund combined.
People often fail to see the power law, which is a fundamental law of
the universe, because it only becomes clear over time; early-stage
companies in a portfolio might look similar before exponential growth
kicks in. Despite being a niche (less than 1% of new businesses receive
VC funding), venture-backed companies disproportionately drive the
economy, creating 11% of private sector jobs and generating 21% of GDP.
The largest tech companies, all venture-backed, are worth more than all
other tech companies combined.</p>
<p>Understanding the power law means focusing on the singular, most
important things (e.g., one best market, one dominant distribution
strategy). To achieve disproportionate success, one must identify and
focus relentlessly on those few critical elements.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chapter 8 Secrets</strong>, Thiel begins by posing his
contrarian question ("<em>What important truth do very few people agree
with you on?</em>") in the context of secrets. He states that a good
answer to this question implies the existence of secrets – something
important, unknown, difficult, but achievable. He argues that secrets
still exist and are crucial for progress.Secrets can lead to monumental
advancements in science, medicine, and technology (e.g., curing
diseases, new energy sources). In business, secrets can lead to valuable
companies built on overlooked opportunities, like Airbnb (untapped
supply and unaddressed demand in lodging) and Uber/Lyft (connecting
drivers and riders). In terms of how to find secrets, Thiel has
discussed about 1) secrets of nature from studying physical world, vs.
secrets about people from understanding human nature, 2) looking at the
fields that matter but haven't been standardized.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 9 Foundations</strong> is around 'Thiel's law': a
startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed, providing guidance
on fundamental level: co-founder relationships, ownership, possession,
and control, small boards, full time commitment, equity is the king,
founding moment, etc. <strong>Chapter 10 The Mechanics of Mafia</strong>
highlights the importance of company culture. <strong>Chapter 11 If You
Build It Will They Come</strong> stresses that distribution (sales,
marketing, advertising) is often underestimated and is just as crucial
as product development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The founding moment of a company, however, really does happen just
once: only at the very start do you have the opportunity to set the
rules that will align people toward the creation of value in the
future.</p>
<p>The most valuable kind of company maintains an openness to invention
that is most characteristic of beginnings. This leads to a second, less
obvious understanding of the founding: it lasts as long as a company is
creating new things, and it ends when creation stops. If you get the
founding moment right, you can do more than create a valuable company:
you can steer its distant future toward the creation of new things
instead of the stewardship of inherited success. You might even extend
its founding indefinitely."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"'Company culture' doesn't exist apart from the company itself: no
company has a culture; every company is a culture. A startup is a team
of people on a mission, and a good culture is just what that looks like
on the inside."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a core debate right now around whether AI is going to
replace human‘s jobs, and this book offers powerful arguments for the
"AI as complement, not replacement" side. Thiel explicitly argued
against the "substitution fallacy" in <strong>Chapter 12 (Man and
Machine)</strong>, stating that computers and humans have different
strengths and will thrive through collaboration. Although Generative AI
is unprecedented with its impact on human society nuanced to discuss, I
agree there are fundamental differences in intelligence between humans
and AI. Human possess intentionality, true innovation, empathy, and
emotional intelligence, and human judgment is needed when there are
ethical concerns or complex problems. AI as a tool can do augmentation
to increase productivity, but not automation. Historically speaking,
tech development always creates more jobs than destroyed. While some
roles are eliminated, new roles emerge: AI engineers, Prompt Engineers,
AI Product Managers, etc. In essence, it's about a redefinition of work,
rather than elimination.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"People compete for jobs and for resources; computers compete for
neither."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Globalization is about substitution. Technology is about
complementarity.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 13 Seeing Green</strong> analyzes the failure of the
cleantech bubble, attributing it to a widespread failure to answer the
seven critical questions every successful business must address.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Engineering Question:</strong> Most offered only
incremental, not breakthrough (10x better), technology (e.g., Solyndra's
inefficient cylindrical solar cells).</li>
<li><strong>The Timing Question:</strong> They misjudged market
readiness and the slow, linear progress of solar technology compared to
exponential tech.</li>
<li><strong>The Monopoly Question:</strong> They pursued
"trillion-dollar markets" that were fiercely competitive, rather than
small, defensible niches.</li>
<li><strong>The People Question:</strong> Teams were often led by
"salesman-executives" lacking technical expertise, focusing on
fundraising over product. (Thiel suggests a "never invest in a tech CEO
that wears a suit" rule.)</li>
<li><strong>The Distribution Question:</strong> Companies often
overlooked effective distribution, leading to complex and inconvenient
sales models (e.g., Better Place's battery swapping).</li>
<li><strong>The Durability Question:</strong> They failed to anticipate
competition (e.g., from China) or market shifts (e.g., the rise of
fracking).</li>
<li><strong>The Secret Question:</strong> They based their ventures on
"conventional truths" (the need for a cleaner world), which everyone
agreed on, rather than unique, hidden insights.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"The 1990s had one big idea: the internet is going to be big. But too
many internet companies had exactly that same idea and no others. An
entrepreneur can't benefit from macroscale insight unless his own plans
begin at the micro-scale. Cleantech companies faced the same problem: no
matter how much the world needs energy, only a firm that offers a
superior solution for a specific energy problem can make money. No
sector will ever be so important that merely participating in it will be
enough to build a great company."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Chapter 14 The Founder's Paradox</strong> explores the often
extreme, contradictory, and seemingly peculiar traits of successful
founders, arguing that these unique characteristics are both powerful
for a company and carry inherent dangers for the founder. Society needs
founders – unusual individuals who can make authoritative decisions,
inspire loyalty, and plan long-term, moving companies beyond
incrementalism. However, founders must be wary of overestimating their
own power and succumbing to their own myth, mistaking public adulation
or criticism for truth. The greatest danger for a founder is losing
their mind; for a business, it's losing its myth and vision.</p>
<p>The current AI boom feels very much like an "accelerating takeoff "
in terms of technological advancement, which is mentioned in the final
chapter "<strong>Conclusion: Stagnation or Singularity</strong>", as one
of the Nick Bostrom's four possible patterns for humanity's future.
Accelerating Takeoff (Singularity) is the most difficult scenario to
imagine: new technologies so powerful that they transcend current
understanding, leading to a much better future. Ray Kurzweil's
"Singularity is near" concept, based on exponential growth trends, is
mentioned as a prominent view of this outcome. However, as Thiel's book
is a manifesto for building a better future and criticizes 'indefinite
optimism', in the context of AI boom, 'Singularity' is not a
predetermined destination, but the choices we make today:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Are we using AI for "0 to 1" innovation to solve truly hard
problems and create new value, or are we just using it for "1 to n"
incremental improvements and fierce competition?</em></li>
<li><em>Are we making definite plans for how AI will integrate with and
enhance human capabilities, or are we succumbing to "indefinite fears"
or blind optimism?</em></li>
<li><em>Are we building companies around unique AI-driven insights that
can create sustainable monopolies, or are we simply entering crowded AI
markets hoping for a piece of an existing pie?</em></li>
</ul>
