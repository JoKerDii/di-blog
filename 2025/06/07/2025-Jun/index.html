<blockquote>
<p><em>The frontier isn’t volume—it’s discernment. And in that shift,
taste has become a survival skill.</em></p>
<p><em>Because when abundance is infinite, attention is everything. And
what you give your attention to—what you consume, what you engage with,
what you amplify—becomes a reflection of how you think.</em></p>
<p><em>What matters now is what you do with it. How you filter it. How
you recognize signal in the noise. Curation is the new IQ test.</em></p>
<p><em>Taste is often dismissed as something shallow or subjective. But
at its core, it’s a form of literacy—a way of reading the world. Good
taste isn’t about being right. It’s about being attuned. To rhythm, to
proportion, to vibe. It’s knowing when something is off, even if you
can’t fully articulate why.</em></p>
<p><em>Taste is what allows you to skim past the performative noise, the
fake depth, the viral bait, and know—instinctively—what’s worth your
time.</em></p>
<p><em>And that’s what real taste is: a deep internal coherence. A way
of filtering the world through intuition that’s been sharpened by
attention.</em></p>
<p><em>When you sharpen your discernment, you stop being swayed by
trends. You stop needing consensus. You stop reacting to every new thing
like it’s urgent.</em></p>
<p><em>There will always be creators. But the ones who stand out in this
era are also curators. People who filter their worldview so cleanly that
you want to see through their eyes. People who make you feel sharper
just by paying attention to what they pay attention to.</em></p>
<p><em>1995 interview with Steve Jobs — <strong>“Ultimately, it comes
down to taste. It comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best
things that humans have done, and then try to bring those things into
what you’re doing.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Good taste isn’t restrictive. It’s expansive. It allows you to
contain multitudes without becoming incongruent.</em></p>
<p><em>But good taste is deep structure. It’s the throughline in
someone’s life. You can see it in the design of their home, the cadence
of their speech, the way they treat people, the books on their
shelves.</em> <em>Taste is how you live a congruent life. Not in the
sense of brand consistency, but in the sense of spiritual alignment. You
can change your mind. Explore new spaces. But your values stay intact.
Your center holds.</em></p>
<p><strong>― Taste Is the New Intelligence - Wild Bare Thoughts</strong>
[<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wildbarestepf.substack.com/p/taste-is-the-new-intelligence">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an amazing article. In an age of infinite content, taste is
your compass. It’s not about elitism—it’s about aligning your attention
with what truly matters to you. We can do these:</p>
<p><strong>Learnings and Suggestions</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Cultivate Discernment Over Consumption: Prioritize depth over
volume in what you read, watch, and engage with. Ask "Is this worth my
time?" before consuming content, creating something, or sharing. Trust
your intuition—if something feels off, skip it.</p></li>
<li><p>Curate Your Inputs (Because They Shape Your Outputs): Unfollow
accounts, mute topics, and unsubscribe from newsletters that don’t align
with your values. Follow thinkers, creators, and curators who
consistently offer depth. Set boundaries (e.g., no mindless scrolling
after 9 PM). Pause after reading/watching to digest, not just
react.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a "Library Mindset" (Not a Wishlist One): Read books,
essays, and long-form work that lingers. Don’t engage with viral content
just because it’s popular. Save/share only what resonates deeply—not
what’s merely entertaining.</p></li>
<li><p>Train Your Taste Like a Muscle: Study great art, writing, music,
and design to refine your sensibility. Remove distractions, unnecessary
commitments, and low-value inputs. Note what ideas/images/sounds stay
with you—these reveal your true taste.</p></li>
<li><p>Embrace Coherence Over Consistency: Your bookshelf, playlists,
and feeds should reflect who you are (or aspire to be). Stay open to new
influences, but filter them through your core principles. Don’t adopt
aesthetics/opinions for status—authenticity matters more.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice "Vibe Coding" (Like Rick Rubin): Whether in
conversations or creativity, prioritize feeling over formulas. In
work/life, strip away excess until only the essential remains. If
something feels "alive," lean in—even if it defies logic.</p></li>
<li><p>Reject Cheap Dopamine for Lasting Satisfaction: Opt for the book
over the tweet, the slow movie over the clip. After consuming something,
ask: Did this uplift or drain me? Regularly eliminate distractions
(apps, subscriptions, habits) that don’t serve you.</p></li>
<li><p>Taste as a Spiritual Practice: Prioritize art/ideas that
rearrange your perspective. From your home to your workspace, align
space with intention. Engage only with what nourishes, not
depletes.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember: Curation = Power: Amplify only what deserves a wider
audience. Your ability to filter signal from noise is a competitive
edge. The more you refine your taste, the more it protects you from
chaos.</p></li>

<p>This article covers an overview of the system (main players), the
value chain (how products and services flow through the system and what
profitable segments are), incentives (motivation of behaviors),
challenges (significant issues within the industry), and potential
solutions (software and AI).</p>
<p>It deeply focuses on the interplay between incentives, middlemen, the
resulting administrative burden, and AI as the specific technological
solution appears to be a key perspective.</p>

Prompts</strong> [<a

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Concepts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction Costs</strong>: Costs incurred in addition to
the actual price of a good or service, necessary to coordinate and
execute a transaction. Marketplaces primarily sell the reduction of
these costs.</li>
<li><strong>TAM Expansion</strong>: Reducing transaction costs lowers
the effective cost of a good or service, increasing demand and expanding
the Total Addressable Market (TAM). The degree of TAM expansion relates
to the percentage of total cost eliminated.</li>
<li><strong>Value Distribution:</strong> Marketplaces save sellers money
on transaction costs and charge them a fee (often similar to what
sellers paid previously). They typically pass efficiency gains on to
buyers in the form of easier and faster experiences, creating a
demand-constrained market. <strong>Variable Costs of Addressing
Transaction Costs:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Variable Costs:</strong> Addressing search and
bargaining costs is highly efficient and has low variable costs.
Marketplaces can keep more of the value created here.</li>
<li><strong>High Variable Costs:</strong> Addressing enforcement and
distribution costs involves significant variable costs (e.g., funding
returns, building logistics). While these make marketplaces bigger,
margins may be lower as value is passed to buyers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong>:</p>
<p>This article puts the concept of transaction costs as central to
understanding marketplaces. Transaction costs are defined as the costs
incurred beyond the actual price of a good or service, associated with
coordinating and executing the transaction itself. Marketplaces are
essentially businesses that sell the reduction of these transaction
costs. Studying transaction costs can help determine where marketplaces
will succeed, what kind of marketplaces to build, and how to price
them.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the article suggests that the "free lunch"
opportunities in many industries are exhausted, pushing marketplaces
into high variable cost activities. This implies future marketplaces may
be higher scale but potentially lower margin and more operationally
intensive. To disrupt incumbent marketplaces, one should look for
remaining transaction costs that can be addressed much more efficiently
than the current solution. The article suggests disrupting food delivery
was possible by building a more efficient network than restaurants had,
but disrupting shipping for handmade goods is harder because it requires
competing with highly efficient companies like UPS and Fedex.</p>
<p>By far, the largest unsolved transaction costs are in the
<strong>services industries</strong> (e.g., freelancing, home
improvement), which constitute two-thirds of consumer spending. Most
services marketplaces are currently stuck at the Lead Generation stage,
limiting penetration and take rate. This might be partly because much
spend is on recurring services where customers leave the marketplace
once a good provider is found, leading services marketplaces to rely on
high-churn consumer subscriptions. Despite this, there are
opportunities, such as Zillow exploring expanding into managed
marketplace territory for home services.</p>

Journal</strong> [<a

</blockquote>
<p>The one hour is suggested to be dedicated to three key practices that
aim to rebuild an individual from the ground up:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Build Something That's Yours</strong>: This involves
creating something that belongs to you, beyond your job, such as a
newsletter, product, service, blog, or by learning/teaching a skill. The
purpose is to "plant seeds" that will compound over time, pulling you
out of stagnation.</li>
<li><strong>Train Like You Want to Be Here for a While</strong>: This
practice emphasizes physical strength and movement, like walking,
running, stretching, lifting, breathing, sleeping deeply, eating real
food, and drinking water. It's a message of self-care and an intention
to use one's body, which also sharpens mental clarity, as Seneca
suggested, "The body should be treated more rigorously, that it may not
be disobedient to the mind".</li>
<li><strong>Create Enough Silence to Hear Your Own Voice</strong>: This
habit counters the constant noise and stimulation of modern life. It
encourages practices like journaling, meditating, taking walks without
headphones, or simply sitting still without a goal or screen. The goal
is not productivity, but presence and creating space for reflection and
insight, preventing thoughts from being drowned out and actions from
remaining unexamined.</li>

<p><strong>How to become friends with literally anyone - April &amp; The
Fool</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aprilandthefool.substack.com/p/how-to-become-friends-with-literally">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article suggests that becoming friends with anyone is to approach
interactions with a deep-seated belief in shared humanity, genuine
curiosity about individual worldviews, and an open, empathetic demeanor
that seeks to understand rather than judge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Try to understand people through conversations with a belief
in the universal commonality of human nature:</strong> The author
fundamentally believes that all people are driven by the same core human
urges and desires, such as the need to feel loved, respected, and seen.
This perspective makes it intuitive to understand others. They see
meeting someone new as a "puzzle of empathy" and a "game of
commonality," where they try to understand what someone would think,
want, need, or crave given their background, values, limitations, and
longings.</li>
<li><strong>From common nature to differences among people due to
environmental factors:</strong> The author acknowledges that
<em>how</em> these needs are defined and achieved varies dramatically
due to factors like nationality, gender, religion, cultural heritage,
socioeconomic class, hobbies, and upbringing. These "little big
differences" are where things become interesting, leading to unique
individual personalities and perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Follow the reasonableness within their personal worldview to
understand motivations and values:</strong> The author believes that
while people may not always be rational, they are always "reasonable"
within their own worldview. This means that everyone has reasons for
their actions, and those reasons make sense within their personal
framework. Understanding a person's circumstances allows the author to
understand their motivations, struggles, and values.</li>
<li><strong>Be curious and genuine while engaging with people:</strong>
The author describes themselves as extremely extraverted, loving people,
and hating small talk. They are curious about people, viewing them as
containing "worlds, histories, stories that span across generations and
geographies". This curiosity leads them to give "rapt attention and
genuine space to be yourself".</li>
<li><strong>Assumption of friendship from the beginning, share stories
and genuine care:</strong> The author approaches new encounters with the
assumption that "we are friends" from the moment they meet. They are
open, putting "all my cards on the table" and inviting others to reveal
theirs. They enjoy conversations, making people feel understood, heard,
and cared for.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The key takeaway is that genuine technological advancement, which
is real and accelerating, must be distinguished from the business models
built around it, which frequently adhere to age-old patterns. When
stated purpose and actual function align, it typically indicates that
the technology addresses a specific, measurable problem with clear
economic value, rather than promising to "transform
everything."</em></p>
<p><em>Systemantics, or, the art of understanding what’s going on, means
recognizing the persistent gaps between what systems proclaim and what
they actually do, and capitalizing on that insight.</em></p>
<p><em>When the fog dissipates and clarity emerges, the survivors will
be those who patiently deciphered the underlying mechanics amidst
fleeting illusions.</em></p>
<p><em>Enduring AI companies will emerge in two distinct spaces by 2035:
unglamorous but essential tools that demonstrably improve margins or
reduce costs, and genuine frontier research that reveals entirely new
problem spaces. The first category refines what exists; the second
invents what doesn't yet.</em></p>
<p><em>Real opportunities lie in the quiet spaces between stated
ambitions and operational truths. Just as they always have.</em></p>

<li>Always take a book with you.</li>
<li>Give it about 50 pages before you quit. This keeps you from getting
stalled on a book that is not resonating with you.</li>
<li>Schedule the reading time. e.g., 45 min in the morning, 30 min in
the evening, and throughout the day when you get breaks.</li>
<li>Weekend sprints. Read in hour-long stretches on weekends or to do
several smaller stretches and get through entire sections or even whole
books on the weekends.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>the article suggests that thinking like a genius involves adopting a
holistic and nuanced approach to problems by utilizing the AQAL model,
encompassing all relevant perspectives (quadrants) and evolving one's
consciousness to a "second-tier" level that can integrate and synthesize
different stages of understanding. This allows for faster
problem-solving and greater achievement in life.</p>
<p><strong>All Quadrants</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual Interior (Upper Left): Your personal thoughts, emotions,
beliefs, and consciousness. Questions in this quadrant might include
core values, what makes you feel alive, or fears holding you back.</li>
<li>Individual Exterior (Upper Right): Your behaviors, actions, and
physical brain states. This involves looking at natural talents,
developed skills, and what your behavior reveals about your
preferences.</li>
<li>Collective Interior (Lower Left): Shared culture, values, and group
consciousness. This could involve understanding parental or religious
expectations, influence of friends, or shared values you're drawn
to.</li>
<li>Collective Exterior (Lower Right): Systems, structures, and social
institutions. This quadrant considers current job opportunities, the
impact of education or technology, and systemic barriers or
advantages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All Levels</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Premodern: Characterized by following established authority and
traditions, with black-and-white thinking and obedience to a God or
conformity.</p></li>
<li><p>Modern: Values science, individual achievement, competition, and
merit-based success.</p></li>
<li><p>Postmodern: Emphasizes relativistic thinking, where everyone's
truth is valid, and focuses on inclusion and equality. The article notes
that postmodern thinking can become pathological when it attempts to
dismantle all hierarchies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Second-Tier</strong>: This is the suggested stage for
"genius" thinkers. Individuals at this level can look back and
synthesize truths from all prior perspectives, embracing complexity,
systems thinking, and awareness. It's less about "I'm right and you're
wrong" and more about <strong>finding the best solution through
synthesis, holding contradictions in mind until they can be
reconciled</strong>. <strong>Genius thinkers act as "translators"
between different stages</strong>.</p></li>

Data</strong> [<a

</blockquote>
<p>A summary of the four junior traits and what to do instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Junior Trait #1: Providing too much
detail/over-explaining</strong>
<ul>
<li>Excessive detail doesn't showcase knowledge and consideration of
edge cases, but it typically confuses the audience and makes them appear
unable to synthesize information, causing key points to be missed.
Managers may even prevent such individuals from presenting to executives
to avoid confusion and inefficiency in meetings.</li>
<li>What to do about it:
<ul>
<li>In written form: Summarize work with a "TL;DR" at the top, using the
Pyramid Principle (conclusion first, then supporting evidence). Focus on
what is important enough to communicate, moving less critical details to
an appendix.</li>
<li>In verbal form: Practice an "elevator pitch" of less than 30 seconds
to peers, focusing on the "why" and enough "what" to allow for opinion
formation. <strong>The ability to decide what NOT to communicate is as
crucial as what to mention.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Junior Trait #2: Not having an opinion or
recommendation</strong>
<ul>
<li>As data scientists become more senior, translating analysis into a
recommendation becomes increasingly important. Hesitation to provide
recommendations often stems from the perceived risk and the nuanced,
non-black-and-white nature of data, leading to "analysis paralysis".
However, not giving recommendations shows a lack of ownership and limits
one to simple "execution" work.</li>
<li>What to do about it:
<ul>
<li>Adopt an <strong>ownership mindset</strong>, imagining you are the
decision-maker. Ask what data <em>you</em> would need and if the
presented data would convince <em>you</em>.</li>
<li>Understand that value comes from giving robust recommendations
<em>despite</em> nuance and ambiguity, just as taking risks can lead to
above-average returns.</li>
<li>While you should list caveats, <strong>most people prefer a
recommendation they disagree with over no recommendation at all, as it
provides a basis for discussion and understanding assumptions.</strong>
Data teams are paid to <strong>drive business decisions,</strong> not
just pull and present data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Junior Trait #3: Not being clear about the "why" behind the
analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li>Junior DS often state "XYZ stakeholder asked for this" as the sole
reason for an analysis, which is insufficient. This indicates a lack of
ownership of the business problem and hinders the ability to deliver
effective solutions, leading to frustration from changing data
requests.</li>
<li>What to do about it:
<ul>
<li><strong>Own the problem</strong>. When asked to pull data, find out
<em>why</em> the stakeholder needs it and what decision they are trying
to make.</li>
<li>By understanding the ultimate business problem, you can
<strong>brainstorm the most effective data solutions</strong>,
potentially different from the original request, thus <strong>elevating
yourself to a</strong> <strong>thought partner</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Junior Trait #4: Not having the basics down to be able to
stay "one step ahead"</strong>
<ul>
<li>Losing credibility happens when people feel you don't know the data
or business area you cover. To establish yourself as an expert, you need
to <strong>anticipate common questions and be the most familiar with the
data in your area</strong>. If you lack answers to natural follow-up
questions, it suggests you haven't thoroughly understood or explored the
data.</li>
<li>What to do about it:
<ul>
<li>Be curious about your data; start with a basic question and explore
from there, jotting down answers.</li>
<li>Anticipate follow-up questions in three buckets before presenting:
<strong>foundational knowledge</strong> (e.g., how the product works,
user numbers), <strong>your analysis</strong> (details beyond the main
insights), and <strong>next steps</strong> (what the findings mean for
stakeholders).</li>
<li>Get a second pair of eyes on your work, ideally from someone not
deep in the analysis, to catch obvious omissions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

</blockquote>
<p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve reasoning via extended thinking
(e.g., multi-step traces), but this leads to inefficiencies like
overthinking simple queries, increasing latency and token usage. The
team Introduces Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models (LHRMs) — the first models
that adaptively choose when to think based on query complexity,
balancing performance and efficiency. They utilizes a two-stage
approach: 1) <strong>Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT)</strong> – cold start
using curated datasets labeled as "think" vs. "non-think"; 2)
<strong>Hybrid Group Policy Optimization (HGPO)</strong> – an online RL
method that trains the model to pick the optimal reasoning mode. They
defines <strong>Hybrid Accuracy</strong> to evaluate how well the model
selects between thinking and non-thinking strategies; correlates
strongly with human judgment. Experiments show LHRMs outperform both
LRMs and traditional LLMs in reasoning accuracy and response quality,
while also reducing unnecessary computation.</p>

<p><strong>How much do language models memorize? - Meta, Google, NVIDIA,
and Cornell University</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24832">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper proposed a new method to quantify how much information a
language model "knows" about a datapoint.</p>
<p>They formally separate memorization into two components by two novel
definitions of memorization: unintended memorization (information about
a specific dataset) and generalization (information about the true
data-generation process).</p>
<p><strong>There are several interesting findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By training models on uniform random bitstrings (eliminating
generalization), they precisely measure model capacity, finding
GPT-style transformers store 3.5 to 4 bits per parameter.</li>
<li>Their framework shows that the double descent phenomenon occurs when
the data size exceeds the model capacity, suggesting that models are
"forced" to generalize when they can no longer individually memorize
datapoints.</li>
<li>The paper develops and validates a scaling law that predicts
membership inference performance based on model capacity and dataset
size, indicating that membership inference becomes harder with larger
datasets relative to model capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To understand their smart methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>They proposed a very clever approach to understand memorization
and model capacity in LM. They isolate unintended memorization by
training models on <strong>uniform random bitstrings</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>No Generalization Signal: When training on truly random data, there
are no underlying patterns, rules, or structures for the model to
generalize from. Each bitstring is an independent, random piece of
information.</li>
<li>Only Memorization is Possible: In this scenario, the <em>only</em>
way for the model to "learn" or perform well on this data (i.e., predict
the next bit in a sequence or identify if it was part of the training
set) is to literally memorize the specific bitstrings it has seen. Any
"knowledge" the model gains is purely about the individual data
points.</li>
<li>Total Memorization as Measured: Therefore, when generalization is
effectively zero, the information the model stores about the random
bitstrings directly reflects its <em>total memorization capacity</em>
for that type of information. There's no "general knowledge" to
distinguish; it's all about remembering specific instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, they are measuring the maximum amount of distinct,
specific information the model can store.</p>
<p>They equal total memorization to model capacity. In machine learning,
model capacity generally refers to the <strong>size and complexity of
the functions a model is capable of learning</strong>. It's the model's
ability to fit a wide variety of patterns in the data. A model with
higher capacity can potentially fit more complex relationships or
memorize more specific data points.</p>
<p>The paper further quantifies this by showing that GPT-style models
have a capacity of approximately 3.6 bits-per-parameter. This indicates
that each parameter in the model effectively acts as a certain amount of
storage for information, reflecting the overall capacity of the neural
network architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>The fundamental challenge in understanding and evaluating
language models is the <strong>ambiguity and conflation of
"memorization" (copy or reproduce a specific sequence in the training
data) and "learning." (truly understand and generalize a pattern or
concept)</strong> This is exactly what they addressed by decomposing
memorization into unintended memorization and generalization. The
decomposition enables controlled measurement and the use of random
bitstrings is the key innovation.</p>
<p>About the Double Descent Phenomena: When a model's capacity exceeds
the generalizable patterns in the data, it starts to memorize individual
data points. As data size increases relative to capacity, the model is
"forced" to generalize more, leading to a decrease in unintended
memorization and an improvement in performance.</p>
<p>The core insight is that as models become massively overparameterized
(far beyond what's needed to simply fit the training data), they find
"simpler" interpolating solutions that generalize better, often due to
the implicit biases of optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD).</p>
<p><strong>Intuition for double descent</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>"Under-parameterized" Regime (Classical ML): Model Capacity &lt;
Data Size: very generalizable, low test error</li>
<li>"Interpolation Threshold" (The Peak): Model Capacity ~ Data Size:
peak of test error, due to overfitting the noise</li>
<li>"Over-parameterized" Regime (Double Descent / Modern Deep Learning):
Model Capacity &gt;&gt; Data Size: robust generalization happens, test
error goes down again.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Here is a concept <strong>Membership Inference Attacks
(MIAs):</strong> These are attacks that attempt to determine whether a
specific data point was part of a model's training dataset or not. A
successful MIA indicates that the model has "memorized" that specific
data point. "Scaling Laws for Membership Inference" in the paper refers
to <strong>predictive relationships that describe how the success rate
of a MIA changes as a function of various model and data
characteristics</strong>, such as model capacity and dataset size.</p>
<p>They basically propose that <strong>membership inference success is
inversely related to how "generalizable" the data point is within the
model's capacity.</strong> In other words, membership inference is
<strong>easier</strong> when the model has high capacity relative to the
dataset size, leading to more unintended memorization of individual data
points. Membership inference becomes <strong>harder</strong> (i.e., less
successful for an attacker) when the dataset size is very large compared
to the model's capacity, or when the model starts to "grok" (generalize)
more.</p></li>

Anthropic</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/reasoning-models-dont-say-think">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The core issue explored is whether the Chain-of-Thought accurately
reflects the model's true reasoning process ("faithfulness"). The
article's research suggests that models frequently do not faithfully
report their reasoning. Researchers tested this by subtly providing
hints (both correct and incorrect) to models during evaluations. They
then checked if the models admitted using these hints in their
Chain-of-Thought explanations. The results showed that models (Claude
3.7 Sonnet and DeepSeek R1) rarely mentioned the hints they used, even
when those hints led them to a different answer or involved potentially
problematic information (like "unauthorized access"). Instead, models
often created fake rationales for their answers.</p>
<p>The researchers also studied reward hacking by constructing synthetic
Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments with injected "reward hacks."
They then finetuned an earlier snapshot of Claude 3.7 Sonnet in these
environments using outcome-based RL. By setting up the environments this
way, they could observe if the models learned to pick the incorrect hint
answer to maximize their reward, and then check if their
Chain-of-Thought verbalized this reward-seeking behavior. They found
that models learned the reward hacks very quickly (selecting the
incorrect hint answer over 99% of the time), but rarely verbalized these
hacks in their Chain-of-Thought (less than 2% of examples in most
environments).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This report examines the potential for AI to cause human extinction.
The authors analyzed three specific scenarios: <strong>the use of
weapons, the release of biological pathogens, and severe climate warming
via malicious geoengineering</strong>. The study concludes that
significant barriers exist for AI to achieve human extinction and it
would likely require intentional AI action and substantial time for the
threats to materialize, allowing for human response and mitigation
efforts. Ultimately, the report suggests that resources dedicated to AI
extinction risk should also support broader global catastrophic risk
mitigation and general AI safety.</p>
<p>This analysis starts from what could cause human extinction and
assesses how AI could contribute to that. The threats are limited to
those can be explored through scenario planning, while those that
involve a deeper level of uncertainty are ignored.</p>

educating himself instead of screaming at his phone? Yeah, he's the one
holding the duct tape.</em></p>
<p><em>It won't be sexy, and it won't be immediate. But intelligence
isn't dead — it's just hungover. And sooner or later, we're going to
need it to crawl out of bed, drink some black coffee, and start fixing
the mess.</em></p>
<p><em>So at the end of the day, stupidity will always be popular — at
least in the U.S. But intelligence — real, patient, compassionate
intelligence — is what keeps the lights on.</em></p>
<p><em>And by the way, that goes for emotional intelligence too, which
is every bit as important.</em></p>
<p><em>So if you're still here, still critically thinking, still
refusing to go quietly into that great dumb night — you're already part
of the resistance.</em></p>
<p><em>Keep going.</em></p>

<p>The author argues that LLMs as agents are improving developer
productivity, and suggests that while the hype around AI can be
annoying, the technology's impact is real and profound. He believes that
those who don't embrace AI in their coding practices will be left
behind.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The author shares a disorienting sense of reality's erosion,
attributing it to various factors, including the relentless pace of
digital information, the overwhelming nature of political events, and
the insidious proliferation of AI. This environment fosters a collective
cognitive detachment and erosion of critical faculties, making it
challenging to discern truth, engage effectively, and maintain a
grounded sense of self and world.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The iPhone maker has launched the Foundation Models framework to
allow users to run a 3B parameter model locally. The framework is part
of Apple Intelligence suite and allows developers to access it using
three lines of code. The model can be used to generate text, extract
summaries, and tag structured information from unstructured text.</p>
<p>Users should be aware of strength and weakness. It's only available
on Apple Intelligence-enabled devices with OS version 26+. You need to
use Xcode Playgrounds to prototype with real model output. You can use
Instruments profiling template to measure latency and token overhead.
There is no support for fine-tuning or external model deployment</p>
