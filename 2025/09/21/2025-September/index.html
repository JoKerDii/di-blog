<p>Companies are transitioning to credit-based pricing models,
particularly for AI services, for several key reasons related to
managing costs, maximizing profitability, accommodating evolving AI
technology, and establishing market standards.</p>
<ul>
<li>The shift to credit-based models is largely driven by challenges
related to AI operational expenses and usage patterns.</li>
<li>Companies are using credits as a mechanism to transition from
flat-rate pricing toward models based on the value delivered.</li>
<li>The move by major technology companies validates and standardizes
the credit model for AI consumption.</li>
<li>Credit models offer flexibility for both vendors and users.</li>

<p>Shaping the opinions of others, or building influence, is about more
than just data and logic. It's about understanding and managing
emotions.</p>
<p>Handling your own emotions: Notice and reflect on what is driving
your actions, such as fear, and then name it. This helps you move
forward with clarity and confidence.</p>
<p>Leading others through their emotions: When you want to get buy-in
for your ideas, help people process their emotions. You can do this by
creating a space that welcomes emotions, validating their concerns, and
then shifting their focus to what they can do to move forward.</p>

<p>The August jobs report is raising concerns among economists due to
several alarming trends. Employers added only 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which
is significantly lower than the 80,000 jobs that analysts had forecast.
The unemployment rate also rose to 4.3%, the highest level since October
2021.</p>
<p>The three top takeaways are</p>

<li>The job market is stalling</li>

<p>The near-finalized framework of a deal between the U.S. and China
concerning the popular social media application TikTok, involves
creating a new U.S. entity to manage the app’s American operations, with
an investor consortium, including Oracle, taking a roughly 80%
controlling stake, which satisfies a recent U.S. law regarding foreign
ownership. A key component of the agreement is the establishment of
American control over user data and the crucial content-recommendation
algorithms, although they will be based on technology licensed from
TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Furthermore, the article
notes that President Trump has delayed the TikTok ban until December as
negotiations conclude, signaling the resolution of a multi-year national
security dispute over the app's influence in the U.S. Both Chinese and
American officials have reached a basic consensus on the terms, which
also include Oracle managing U.S. user data at its facilities in
Texas.</p>

<p>Dojo was a custom-built supercomputer intended to be the cornerstone
of Tesla's AI ambitions, specifically for training the neural networks
of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and humanoid robots.</p>
<p>The primary strategic reasons cited for the project's termination
include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the strategic pivot to AI6 chips. The AI6 chip is Tesla’s new
strategic bet on a chip design intended to scale across FSD, Tesla’s
Optimus humanoid robots, and high-performance AI training in data
centers</li>
<li>moving away from hardware self-reliance. Dojo was intended to reduce
reliance on expensive eand difficulty-to-secure Nvidia GPUs, but Tesla
is now "going all-in on partnerships" with major chip providers,
including Nvidia, AMD, and Samsung (which will build the AI6 chip)</li>
<li>technological and compatibility hurdles. Dojo’s design, based on
proprietary D1 chips, faced inherent technological challenges related to
integration with the broader AI ecosystem</li>
<li>internal competition and redundency. In August 2024, Tesla began
promoting Cortex, described as the company’s "giant new AI training
supercluster" being built at Tesla HQ in Austin. Cortex was later
deployed at Gigafactory Texas.</li>

<p>While existing machine learning (ML) models optimize for high
engagement, they can result in repetitive and potentially "spammy"
notifications, leading users to disable them. To combat this, the new
framework applies a multiplicative penalty to notification scores based
on their similarity to recently sent ones, using criteria such as author
and product type. This strategy has successfully reduced notification
volume while increasing engagement rates by ensuring a more varied and
personalized mix of content.</p>
<p>The methodology begins with the existing machine learning (ML)
models, which calculate a base score for notification candidates based
on factors like the probability of a user clicking (Click-Through-Rate
or CTR) and time spent. The new framework introduces a diversity layer
on top of these existing engagement ML models.</p>
<p>The methodology involves the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Evaluation of Similarity:</strong> The diversity layer
evaluates each notification candidate's similarity to recently sent
notifications across multiple dimensions, such as content, author,
notification type, and product surface.</li>
<li><strong>Application of Penalties:</strong> The system applies
carefully calibrated penalties, expressed as multiplicative demotion
factors, to downrank candidates that are too similar or repetitive to
recent notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Re-ranking:</strong> The adjusted scores (base relevance
score multiplied by the demotion factor) are used to re-rank the
candidates.</li>
<li><strong>Selection:</strong> The final selection process uses a
quality bar to choose the top-ranked candidate that successfully passes
both the ranking and diversity criteria.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within the diversity layer, the methodology is mathematically
implemented using a multiplicative demotion factor applied to the base
relevance score:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Final Score } (S(c)) = \text{Base
Ranking Score } (R(c)) \cdot \text{Diversity Demotion Multiplier }
(D(c))\]</span></p>
<p>Key aspects of this calculation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demotion Multiplier (<span
class="math inline">\(D(c)\)</span>):</strong> This is a penalty factor
where the value falls within the range of 0 to 1 (<span
class="math inline">\(D(c) \in\)</span>), reducing the score based on
similarity to recently sent notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Similarity Signal:</strong> To calculate <span
class="math inline">\(D(c)\)</span>, a similarity signal (<span
class="math inline">\(p_i(c)\)</span>) is computed for a set of semantic
dimensions (e.g., author, product type) using a maximal marginal
relevance (MMR) approach.</li>
<li><strong>Binary Baseline:</strong> In the baseline implementation,
the similarity signal <span class="math inline">\(p_i(c)\)</span> is
binary: it equals 1 if the similarity exceeds a predefined threshold
(<span class="math inline">\(\tau_i\)</span>), and 0 otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Control:</strong> The methodology defines the final
demotion multiplier using adjustable weights (<span
class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>), which control the strength of
demotion for each respective dimension.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>The best roadmaps aren't checklists; they tell a story about why
something is being built. They show how short-term initiatives connect
to long-term strategic goals.</p>
<p>The <strong>Now, Next, Later Framework</strong> is a core pattern,
reflecting the reality of uncertainty. Now initiatives are tight,
concrete, and focused on current goals (e.g., MVP launch). Next
initiatives are more exploratory bets. Later initiatives are
deliberately fuzzy, long-term aspirations that signal intent without
making firm promises.</p>
<p>Effective roadmaps frame initiatives as problems to solve and tie
them to clear outcomes and business objectives (e.g., "reduce onboarding
friction" instead of "ship a new login flow"). This keeps the team
flexible and focused on results.</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all roadmap. A startup's roadmap is about
survival and proving a hypothesis. A scale-up's roadmap is about
smoothing friction and deepening engagement. A hardware roadmap must
account for manufacturing cycles, while a mission-critical one must
prioritize compliance and security.</p>

<p>A point made around 'reskilling': While GenAI can immediately boost a
worker's aptitude for new tasks, it does not necessarily "reskill" them
in a traditional sense. The study found that participants were able to
perform complex data-science tasks with the help of GenAI, but they did
not retain the knowledge or skills gained after the tools were taken
away. The article refers to GenAI as an "exoskeleton" that enables
workers to do more, but does not intrinsically change what they have
learned.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Seven Non-Obvious Strategies</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Never rely only on online submission: Avoid the "digital dustbin" by
finding an alternative path in, such as a referral, connection, or
direct reach-out.</li>
<li>Ask for advice, not a job: Sincerely seek guidance on entering a
field or company, as people are often generous and may uncover new
opportunities for you.</li>
<li>Give them a reason to say yes: Counter the process of finding
reasons to say <em>no</em> (misspellings, poor grammar) by providing
human connection points like shared alma maters, hobbies, or passions to
hack affinity bias.</li>
<li>Find the “you-shaped hole”: Seek roles where your unique skills,
experience, or passion make you the best bet, demonstrating you can "hit
the ground running on day one".</li>
<li>See the world through the hiring manager’s eyes: Hiring managers
prioritize managing risk because a bad hire is costly. Your job is to
close the asymmetry of information, prove you are a "sure bet," and show
you are a great return on investment.</li>
<li>Do the job before you get the job: Demonstrate initiative by acting
like an employee; use the product, talk to customers, and bring specific
ideas or prototypes to show you want <em>this</em> job.</li>
<li>Tailor your resume (and your story) for the role: Treat your resume
as a "living document" to tell a specific story, reframing factual
experiences to align with the target role and "speak the language of the
hiring company".</li>

<p><em>Hallucinations persist partly because current evaluation methods

<p><strong>― Why language models hallucinate - OpenAI</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several clarifications mentioned in this blog:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Accuracy will never reach 100%</li>
<li>Hallucinations are not inevitable. Language models can choose to
abstain when uncertain. Abstaining (indicating uncertainty) is better
than providing confident, incorrect information, aligning with the core
value of humility</li>
<li>Avoiding hallucination can be easier for a small model to know its
limits. Being "calibrated" (knowing its confidence) requires much less
computation than being accurate</li>
<li>To measure hallucinations, all of the primary evaluation metrics
need to be reworked to reward expressions of uncertainty. Hallucination
evals have little effect against hundreds of traditional accuracy-based
evals that punish humility</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Key findings:</p>
<p>I. Adoption Speed and Shift to Delegation</p>
<ul>
<li>AI adoption is occurring at an unprecedented speed, reaching in two
years the adoption rates that took the internet around five years. In
the US, 40% of employees report using AI at work, doubling the rate from
two years prior in 2023.</li>
<li>Usage patterns on Claude.ai show a net shift toward delegation
(automation). The share of "Directive" conversations, where users
delegate complete tasks, jumped from 27% to 39%, meaning automation
usage now exceeds augmentation usage for the first time.</li>
<li>There is sustained growth in knowledge-intensive tasks like
education and science. In coding, there is a net shift of 7.4 percentage
points toward program creation and away from debugging, suggesting
models have become more reliable.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>Geographic Concentration and Inequality Risk</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>AI usage is highly geographically concentrated and correlates
strongly with income across countries. A 1% increase in GDP per
working-age capita is associated with a 0.7% increase in Claude usage
per capita.</li>
<li>Small, technologically advanced economies lead in per-capita
adoption, with Israel (7x expected usage) and Singapore (4.57x expected
usage) being top examples.</li>
<li>Low-adoption countries are more likely to delegate complete tasks
(automation), while high-adoption countries tend toward greater learning
and collaborative iteration (augmentation), even when controlling for
task mix.</li>
<li>Current usage patterns suggest that AI benefits may concentrate in
already-rich regions, potentially increasing global economic
inequality.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>Enterprise Automation and Deployment Bottlenecks</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise usage via the 1P API is predominantly
automation-dominant, with 77% of business uses involving automation
patterns (delegating tasks programmatically), compared to about 50% for
Claude.ai users.</li>
<li>Business deployment is largely price-insensitive. Model capabilities
and the economic value of automation appear to matter more than cost, as
higher-cost tasks tend to have higher usage rates.</li>
<li>For complex tasks, deployment is constrained by the access to
information rather than just model capabilities. Companies face a
bottleneck requiring costly data modernization and organizational
investments to centralize the contextual information needed for
sophisticated AI use.</li>
