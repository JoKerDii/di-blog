    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Being a leader requires 'followers' only, those who volunteer to go
where you are going rather than being incentivized to, threatened to, or
having to. And leadership requires a vision of the world that does not
yet exist and the ability to communicate it. The former is the tangible
result of what the world would like if we spent every day pursuing WHY,
due to the power of WHY in inspiring action. The inspirational book
'<em>Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take
Action</em>' written by Simon Sinek explores this concept deeply,
arguing that the most successful and inspiring leaders communicate from
the inside outâ€”starting with their 'Why' (purpose or belief), then 'How'
(process), and finally 'What' (product or service). This is a very
inspiring book to read, for any type of leaders who is pursuing profound
fulfillment.</p>

</figure>
<p>Below are the quotations I've selected from the book.</p>
<p><strong>Manipulations are the norm, but the better alternative is
inspiration</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the business world, manipulations are the norm in politics
today as well. Just as manipulations can drive a sale but not create
loyalty, so too can they help a candidate get elected, but they don't
create a foundation for leadership. Leadership requires people to stick
with you through thick and thin. Leadership is the ability to rally
people not for a single event, but for years. In business, leadership
means that customers will continue to support your company even when you
slip up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Manipulative techniques have become such a mainstay in American
business today that it has become virtually impossible for some to kick
the habit. Like any addiction, the drive is not to get sober, but to
find the next fix faster and more frequently. And as good as the
short-term highs may feel, they have a deleterious impact on the
long-term health of an organization. Addicted to the short-term results,
business today has largely become a series of quick fixes added on one
after another after another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Leaders who choose to inspire people rather than manipulate
people follow the concept of 'The Golden Circle'.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Golden Circle is an alternative perspective to existing
assumptions about why some leaders and organizations have achieved such
a disproportionate degree of influence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This alternative perspective is not just useful for changing the
world; there are practical applications for the ability to inspire, too.
It can be used as a guide to vastly improve leadership, corporate
culture, hiring, product development, sales, and marketing. It even
explains loyalty and how to create enough momentum to turn an idea into
a social movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Companies try to sell us WHAT they do, but we buy WHY they do it.
This is what I mean when I say they communicate from the outside in;
they lead with WHAT and HOW. When communicating from inside out,
however, the WHY is offered as the reason to buy and the WHATs serve as
the tangible proof of that belief. The things we can point to
rationalize or explain the reasons we're drawn to one product, company
or idea over another.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the WHY is absent, imbalance is produced and manipulations
thrive. And when manupulations thrive, uncertainty increases for buyers,
instability increases for sellers and stress increases for all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Biologically, the limbic brain drives behaviors (decisions).
Great leaders win hearts before minds.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are drawn to leaders and organizations that are good at
communicating what they believe. Their ability to make us feel like we
belong, to make us feel special, safe, and not alone is part of what
gives them the ability to inspire us. Those whom we consider great
leaders all have an ability to draw us close and to command our loyalty.
And we feel a strong bond with those who are also drawn to the same
leaders and organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The newest area of the brain, our Homo Sapien brain, is the
neocortex, which corresponds with the WHAT level. The neocortex is
responsible for rational and analytical thought and language. The middle
two sections comprise the limbic brain. The limbic brain is responsible
for all of our feelings, such as trust and loyalty. It's also
responsible for all human behavior and all our decision making, but it
has no capacity for language.</p>
<p>When we communicate from the outside in, when we communicate WHAT we
do first, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated
information, like facts and features, but it does not drive behavior.
But when we communicate from the inside out, we're talking directly to
the part of the brain allows us to rationalize those decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our limbic brain is powerful, powerful enough to drive behavior that
sometimes contradicts our rational and analytical understanding of a
situation. We often trust our gut, even if the decision flies in the
face of all the facts and figures. Richard Restak, a well-known
neuroscientist, talks about this in his book, The Naked Brain. When you
force people to make decisions with only the rational part of their
brain, they almost invariably end up 'overthinking.' These rational
decisions tend to take longer to make, says Restak, and can often be of
lower quality. In contrast, decisions made with the limbic brain, gut
decisions, tend to be faster, higher-quality decisions.</p>
<p>Our limbic brains are smart and often know the right thing to do. It
is our inability to verbalize the reasons that may cause us to doubt
ourselves or trust the empirical evidence when our gut tells us not
to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. A failure to
communicate WHY creates nothing but stress or doubt.</p>
<p>Those decisions started with WHY - the emotional component of the
decision - and then the rational components allowed the buyer to
verbalize or rationalize the reasons for their decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great leaders are those who trust their gut. They are those who
understand the art before the science. They win hearts before minds.
They are the ones who start with WHY. "I can make a decision with 30
percent of the information, " said former Secretary of State Colin
Powell. "Anything more than 80 percent is too much." There is always a
level at which we trust ourselves or those around us to guide us, and
don't always feel we need all the facts and figures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our hope, dreams, hearts, and guts drive us to try new
things, not logic or facts.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we were all rational, there would be no small businesses, there
would be no exploration, there would be very little innovation and there
would be no great leaders to inspire all those things. It is the undying
belief in something bigger and better that drives that kind of
behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In reality, their purchase decision and their loyalty are deeply
personal. They don't really care about Apple; it's all about them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Products are not just symbols of what the company believes, they also
serve as symbols of what the loyal buyers believe.</p>
<p>Products with a clear sense of WHY give people a way to tell the
outside world who they are and what they believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Clarity of WHY, discipline of HOW, and Consistency of WHAT
are all needed.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask the best salesmen what it takes to be a great salesman. They will
always tell you that it helps when you really believe in the product
you're selling... When salesmen actually believe in the thing they are
selling, then the words that come out of their mouths are authentic.
When belief enters the equation, passion exudes from the salesman. It is
this authenticity that produces the relationships upon which all the
best sales organizations are based. Relationships also build trust. And
with trust comes loyalty. Absent a balanced Golden Circle means no
authenticity, which means no strong relationships, which means no trust.
And you're back at square one selling on price, service, quality or
features. You are back to being like everyone else. Worse, without that
authenticity, companies resort to manipulation: pricing, promotions,
peer pressure, fear, take your pick. Effective? Of course, but only for
the short term.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If they buy something that doesn't clearly embody their own sense of
WHY, then those around them have little evidence to paint a clear and
accurate picture of who they are. The human animal is a social animal.
We're very good at sensing subtleties in behavior and judging people
accordingly. We get good feelings and bad feelings about companies, just
as we get good feelings and bad feelings about people. There are some
people we just feel we can trust and others we just feel we can't.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Trust begins to emerge when we have a sense that the driver
of behaviors is anything but self-gain.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trust is not a checklist. Fulfilling all your responsibilities does
not create trust. Trust is a feeling, not a rational experience. We
trust some people and companies even when things go wrong, and we don't
trust others even though everything might have gone exactly as it should
have. A completed checklist does not guarantee trust. Trust begins to
emerge when we have a sense that another person or organization is
driven by things other than their own self-gain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who lead are able to do so because those who follow trust that
the decisions made at the top have the best interests of the group at
heart. In turn, those who trust work hard because they feel like they
are working for something bigger than themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When people come to work with a higher sense of purpose, they find it
easier to weather hard times or even to find opportunity in those hard
times. People who come to work with a clear sense of WHY are less prone
to giving up after a few failures because they understand the higher
cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Finding the people who believe what you believe</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do better in cultures in which we are good fits. We do better in
places that reflect our own values and beliefs. Just as the goal is not
to do business with anyone who simply wants what you have, but to do
business with people who believe what you believe, so too is it
beneficial to live and work in a place where you will naturally thrive
because your values and beliefs align with the values and beliefs of
that culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When employees belong, they will guarantee your success. And they
won't be working hard and looking for innovative solutions for you, they
will be doing it for themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As Herb Kelleher famously said, "you don't hire for skills, you hire
for attitude. You can always teach skills."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The truth is, almost every person on the planet is passionate; we are
not all passionate for the same things.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal is to hire those who are passionate for your WHY, your
purpose, cause or belief, and who have the attitude that fits your
culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great companies don't hire skilled people and motivate them; they
hire already motivated people and inspire them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If those inside the organization are a good fit, the opportunity to
"go the extra mile", to explore, to invent, to innovate, to advance, and
more importantly, to do so again and again and again, increases
dramatically. Only with mutual trust can an organization become
great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Law of Diffussion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our population is broken into five segments that fall across a bell
curve: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and
laggards.</p>
<p>Early adopters are willing to pay a premium or suffer some level of
inconvenience to own a product or espouse an idea that feels right.
Their willingness to suffer an inconvenience or pay a premium had less
to do with how great the product was and more to do with their own sense
of who they are. They wanted to be the first.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The farther right you go on the curve, the more you will encounter
the clients and customers who may need what you have, but don't
necessarily believe what you believe. As clients, they are the ones for
whom, no matter how hard you work, it's never enough. Everything usually
boils down to price with them. They are rarely loyal. They rarely give
referrals and sometimes you may even wonder out loud why you still do
business with them, "They just don't get it," our gut tells us. The
importance of identifying this group is so that you can avoid doing
business with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is an irony to mass-market success, as it turns out. It's near
impossible to achieve if you point your marketing and resources to the
middle of the bell, if you attempt to woo those who represent the middle
of the curve without first appealing to the early adopters. It can be
done, but at a massive expense. This is because the early majority,
according to Rogers, will not try something until someone else has tried
it first. The early majority, indeed the entire majority, needs the
recommendation of someone else who has already sampled the product or
service.</p>
<p>That's what a manipulation is. They may buy, but they won't be loyal.
Don't forget, loyalty is when people are willing to suffer some
inconvenience or pay a premium to do business with you. They may even
turn down a better offer from someone else - something the late majority
rarely does.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Get enough people on the left side of the curve on your side and they
encourage the rest to follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Energy excites. Charisma inspires.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charisma has nothing to do with energy; it comes from a clarity of
WHY. It comes from absolute conviction in an ideal bigger than oneself.
Energy, in contrast, comes from a good night's sleep or lots of
caffeine. Energy can excite. But only charisma can inspire. Charisma
commands loyalty. Energy does not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Golden Circle matches an organization</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sitting at the top of the system, representing the WHY, is a leader;
in the case of a company, that's usually the CEO. The next level down,
the HOW level, typically includes the senior executives who are inspired
by the leader's vision and know HOW to bring it to life. Don't forget
that a WHY is just a belief, HOWs are the actions we take to realize
that belief and WHATs are the results of those actions. No matter how
charismatic or inspiring the leader is, if there are not people in the
organization inspired to bring that vision to reality, to build an
infrastructure with systems and processes, then at best, inefficiency
reigns, and at worst, failure results.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WHY-types are focused on the things most people can't see, like the
future. HOW-types are focused on things most people can see and tend to
be better at building structures and processes and getting things
done.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people in the world are HOW-types. Most people are quite
functional in the real world and can do their jobs and do very well.
Some may be very successful and even make millions of dollars, but they
will never build billion-dollar businesses or change the world.
HOW-types don't need WHY-types to do well. Buy WHY-guys, for all their
vision and imagination, often get the short end of the stick. Without
someone inspired by their vision and the knowledge to make it a reality,
most WHY-types end up as starving visionaries, people with all the
answers but never accomplishing much themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When a company is small, it revolves around the personality of the
founder. There is no debate that the founder's personality is the
personality of the company. As a company grows, the CEO's job is to
personify the WHY. To ooze of it. To talk about it. To preach it. To be
a symbol of what the company believes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We all know when a company's WHY goes fuzzy. Split can
happen.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Wal-Mart, WHAT they do and HOW they are doing it hasn't changed.
And it has nothing to do with Wal-Mart being a 'corporation'; they were
one of those before the love started to decline. What has changed is
that their WHY went fuzzy. And we all know it. A company once so loved
is simply not as loved anymore. The negative feelings we have for the
company are real, but the part of the brain that is able to explain why
we feel so negatively toward them has trouble explaining what changed.
So we rationalize and point to the most tangible things we can see -
size and money. If we, as outsiders, have lost clarity of Wal-Mart's
WHY, it's a good sign that the WHY has gone fuzzy inside the company
also. If it's not clear on the inside, it will never be clear on the
outside. What is clear is that the Wal-Mart of today is not the Wal-Mart
that Sam Walton built.</p>
<p>It's too easy to say that all they care about is their bottom line.
All companies are in business to make money, but being successful at it
is not the reason why things change so drastically. That only points to
a symptom. Without understanding the reason it happened in the first
place, the pattern will repeat for every other company that makes it
big. It is not destiny or some mystical business cycle that transforms
successful companies into impersonal Goliaths. It's people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For most of us, somewhere in the journey, we forget WHY we set out on
the journey in the first place. Somewhere in the course of all those
achievements, an inevitable split happens.</p>
<p>Those with an ability to never lose sight of WHY, no matter how
little or how much they achieve, can inspire us. Those with the ability
to never lose sight of WHY and also achieve the milestones that keep
everyone focused in the right direction are the great leaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As this metric grows, any company can become a 'leading' company. But
it is the ability to inspire, to maintain clarity of WHY, that gives
only a few people and organizations the ability to lead. The moment at
which the clarity of WHY starts to go fuzzy is the split. At this point,
organizations may be loud, but they are no longer clear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The challenge isn't to cling to the leader, it's to find effective
ways to keep the founding vision alive forever.</p>
<p>For an organization to continue to inspire and lead beyond the
lifetime of its founder, the founder's WHY. must be extracted and
integrated into the culture of the company. What's more, a strong
succession plan should aim to find next generation. Future leaders and
employees alike must be inspired by something bigger than the force of
personality of the founder and must see beyond profit and shareholder
value alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The WHY originates from looking back</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before it can gain any power or achieve any impact, an arrow must be
pulled backward, 180 degrees away from the target. And that's also where
a WHY derives its power. The WHY does not come from looking ahead at
what you want to achieve and figuring out an appropriate strategy to get
there. It is not born out of any market research. It does not come from
extensive interviews with customers or even employees. It comes from
looking in the completely opposite direction from where you are now.
Finding WHY is a process of discovery, not invention.</p>
