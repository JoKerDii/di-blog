<p>Identify your values -&gt; turn values into time commitments -&gt;
create a timeboxed calendar -&gt; track distractions -&gt; reflect and
refine weekly. Do remember to schedule fun activities, use flexible
categories, and be aware that the goal isn't finishing tasks.</p>
<p>Some key ideas in the article backed by behaviorial science:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to <em>The Happiness Trap</em> by Russ Harris (Acceptance
and Commitment Therapy - ACT), productivity should align with personal
values (e.g., health, relationships, growth) rather than just task
completion.</li>
<li>People often ignore realistic time estimates in favor of optimistic
ones, leading to overpacked schedules and missed deadlines.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Especially in the Bay Area, the problem isn’t mediocrity—it’s
misdirected excellence. Kids under Chua’s parenting style rarely have a
choice in their own extracurriculars from elementary through high
school. (I doubt being vice-president of the National Honor Society is a
dream to most.) Sure, it can produce a passable overachiever who knows
how to get A’s. But to produce someone capable of real vision, high
agency, and contrarian thinking, the irony is that that overachiever may
be ill-prepared as we approach an era where AI handles rote tasks and
the knowledge economy demands more creativity.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>True excellence and future success come from fostering
agency—self-directed purpose, curiosity, and ownership—rather than
forcing kids to conform to hyper-competitive, checklist-driven
achievement cultures (like those common in the Bay Area).</p>
<p>What's the root problem? - <strong>misdirected
excellence</strong></p>
<p>What's the solution? - Give kids <strong>structure</strong>
(boundaries, values) but <strong>autonomy</strong> (freedom to pursue
interests).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Venture capital in 2025 is a dying industry clinging to AI as its
last hope, with most investment funneled into OpenAI and a few other
hyped players while the rest of the startup ecosystem collapses. The
sector, which thrived on zero-interest-rate euphoria, now faces a harsh
reality: no exits, frozen IPOs, and a market unwilling to fund
early-stage ventures. VCs blame Trump’s chaotic tariffs—despite many
having supported him—but the real issue is their own inability to adapt
to a normal economy. The NVCA report offers no solutions, just desperate
optimism, as the industry’s leaders—many of whom lucked into
success—flail in ideological fringe movements and pray for a miracle.
The only remaining question is whether AI will keep the bubble inflated
long enough for them to cash out before it all implodes.</p>

<p>Nadella’s endorsement signals Microsoft’s commitment to open
protocols over proprietary ecosystems, aligning with his long-standing
advocacy for interoperability (e.g., ONNX, GitHub’s multi-model
approach). By backing A2A (agent-to-agent communication) and MCP
(model-data context standardization), Microsoft ensures Copilot,
Foundry, and Azure AI can seamlessly integrate with third-party AI
agents and tools. This move preempts enterprise concerns about vendor
lock-in, a criticism of past Microsoft products.</p>

<p>why it's so hard to shift from lagacy automaker to SDV (software
designed vehicle) company?</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultural shift: Legacy automakers treated software as an
afterthought, not a core product. Now, they must adopt a Silicon
Valley-like approach.</li>
<li>Supplier dependence: Traditional automakers rely on suppliers for
ECUs, creating a tangled web of software layers.</li>
<li>Safety vs. agility: They must balance "move fast and break things"
with "zero defects or recalls."</li>
<li>Hybrid challenges: Slowing EV demand means SDV systems must also
work with internal-combustion vehicles, complicating power and update
logistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Legacy automakers must become software companies to survive, but the
transition is painfully slow and expensive. The winners will be those
who can blend Silicon Valley speed with automotive-grade
reliability—something no traditional automaker has fully achieved
yet.</p>

<p>The most inspiring leaders today aren’t just adapting—they’re
<strong>rewriting the rules</strong>. Leadership isn’t a pinnacle; it’s
a <strong>daily practice of courage and reinvention</strong>. The world
doesn’t need more bosses; it needs <strong>architects of
possibility</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Myth of the Omniscient Leader</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Shift: From "knowing it all" to curiosity-driven
collaboration.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Adopt a "Learn It All" mindset (Microsoft’s Satya Nadella
famously replaced "Know It All" with this).<br />
</li>
<li>Tool: Host "No Answers Meetings" where leaders openly discuss
unsolved problems, inviting teams to co-create solutions. Example:
Google’s "20% Time" empowers employees to explore innovations beyond
their core roles, democratizing problem-solving.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Embracing the Illusion of Control</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Shift: From command-and-control to adaptive
stewardship.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Practice "Scenario Planning" (like Shell Oil’s famed
strategy) to prepare for multiple futures, not just one.<br />
</li>
<li>Mindset: View volatility as a laboratory for innovation. Spotify’s
"Fail Fast, Learn Fast" approach rewards experimentation.<br />
</li>
<li>Quote: <em>"The art of leadership is not to control, but to
unleash."</em> — Reed Hastings, Netflix.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Leadership Pipeline Crisis</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Root Cause: Short-term efficiency has gutted long-term talent
development.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix: Reverse Mentorship Programs (e.g., GE’s junior employees mentor
execs on digital trends).<br />
</li>
<li>Metric: Track "Readiness Ratios"—how many high-potentials are
prepared for next-level roles?<br />
</li>
<li>Warning: Deloitte’s research shows 89% of executives see "weak
leadership benches" as their top threat.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Death of Cookie-Cutter Playbooks</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>New Rule: Context over conformity.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Build "Modular Strategies"—flexible frameworks adjusted in
real-time (like Amazon’s "Working Backwards" method).<br />
</li>
<li>Tool: Use "Pre-Mortems" (anticipating failures before launch) to
stress-test strategies. Example: Blockbuster’s rigid playbook failed,
while Netflix’s pivot to streaming embraced uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Respect as a Daily Earned Currency</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key: Authenticity &gt; Authority.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Practice "Radical Transparency" (like Bridgewater
Associates’ culture of brutal honesty).<br />
</li>
<li>Tool: Replace "All Hands Meetings" with "All Hearts Meetings"—forums
for empathy and vulnerability. Example: Edelman’s Trust Barometer shows
employees trust "a peer like me" 3x more than CEOs.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Rebuilding Trust in Judgment</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Antidote: Inclusive Decision-Making.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Form "Shadow Boards" (e.g., Gucci’s millennial council
advising execs).<br />
</li>
<li>Rule: For major decisions, require "Disagree &amp; Commit" (document
dissent but align once decided). Example: Patagonia’s CEO involves
employees in sustainability bets, building trust through shared
stakes.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Titles vs. Influence</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>New Power Model: Fluid Hierarchies.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Action: Adopt "Holacracy Lite" (like Zappos’ role-based authority,
not title-based).<br />
</li>
<li>Symbolic Step: Drop "CEO" for "Chief Enabler" (as some startups do
to signal servant leadership).<br />
</li>
<li>Stat: 72% of Gen Z workers prefer "Project Leaders" over "Managers"
(McKinsey, 2024).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>The Reinvention Imperative</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Framework: "Learn, Unlearn, Relearn" (Alvin Toffler’s
future-proofing mantra).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tool: "Skills Gap Heatmaps"—quarterly self-assessments on emerging
competencies (e.g., AI literacy).<br />
</li>
<li>Example: Adobe’s "Kickbox" program gives employees $1,000 to test
new ideas, forcing leaders to adapt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Path Forward: Leadership as a Dynamic
Practice</strong></p>
<p>Your closing question—<em>"Will you be one of them?"</em>—is the call
to action. Leaders who thrive will:<br />
1. Lead with Questions, not answers.<br />
2. Treat Trust as Currency, not a given.<br />
3. Build Antifragile Teams (Nassim Taleb’s concept of growing stronger
through chaos).<br />
4. Measure Success in Learning Cycles, not quarterly profits alone.</p>

<p>The pandemic hiring spree, rising interest rates, and the AI arms

<p><strong>Zero to One: Learning Agentic Patterns - Philschmid</strong>
[<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.philschmid.de/agentic-pattern?utm_source=alphasignal">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This guide explores techniques such as prompt chaining, routing,
parallelization, reflection, tool integration, planning, and multi-agent
collaboration. It features practical code examples for each pattern,
enabling the development of efficient, context-aware workflows with
Google DeepMind Gemini. Emphasis is placed on structured strategies to
enhance task delegation and agent coordination.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Our research shows that by 2030, data centers are projected to
require <span class="math inline">\(\text{\$6.7}\)</span> trillion
worldwide to keep pace with the demand for compute power. Data centers
equipped to handle AI processing loads are projected to require <span
class="math inline">\(\$5.2\)</span> trillion in capital expenditures,
while those powering traditional IT applications are projected to
require <span class="math inline">\(\$1.5\)</span> trillion in capital
expenditures (see sidebar “What about non-AI workloads?”). Overall,
that’s nearly <span class="math inline">\(\$7\)</span> trillion in
capital outlays needed by 2030—a staggering number by any
measure.</em></p>
<p><em>To qualify our <span class="math inline">\(\$5.2\)</span>
trillion investment forecast for AI infrastructure, it’s important to
note that our analysis likely undercounts the total capital investment
needed, as our estimate quantifies capital investment for only three out
of five compute power investor archetypes—<strong>builders, energizers,
and technology developers and designers</strong>—that directly finance
the infrastructure and foundational technologies necessary for AI growth
(see sidebar “Five types of data center investors”). Approximately 15
percent (<span class="math inline">\(\$0.8\)</span> trillion) of
investment will flow to builders for land, materials, and site
development. Another 25 percent (<span
class="math inline">\(\$1.3\)</span> trillion) will be allocated to
energizers for power generation and transmission, cooling, and
electrical equipment. The largest share of investment, 60 percent (<span
class="math inline">\(\$3.1\)</span> trillion), will go to technology
developers and designers, which produce chips and computing hardware for
data centers. The other two investor archetypes,
<strong>operators</strong>, such as hyperscalers and colocation
providers, and <strong>AI architects</strong>, which build AI models and
applications, also invest in compute power, particularly in areas such
as AI-driven automation and data center software. But quantifying their
compute power investment is challenging because it overlaps with their
broader R&amp;D spending.</em></p>

noting that AI adoption is rapidly increasing and demonstrating
significant benefits for early adopters. It emphasizes three key steps
for businesses: understanding where AI can add value by focusing on
repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and navigating ambiguity; teaching
teams fundamental AI use cases like content creation, research, and
automation; and prioritizing opportunities using an impact/effort
framework to determine which projects to pursue and scale.</p>

<p>Real search engines return unpredictable results, complicating
training. While ZeroSearch uses <strong>curriculum-based
rollouts</strong>, gradually degrading document quality to teach the
model to discern useful information.</p>

<p><em>I'll tell you my hiring experience. We have about 30 people at
8090 and the way that I have found it to work the best is you have
senior people act as mentors and then you have an overwhelming corpus of
young very talented people who are AI native. And if you don't find that
mix, what you have instead are L7s from Google and Amazon and Meta who
come to you with extremely high salary demands and stock demands and
they just don't thrive. And part of why they don't thrive is that they
push back on the tools and how you use them. They push back on all these
things that the tools help you get to it faster. M this is why I think
it's so important for the young folks to just jump in with two feet and
be AI native from the jump because you're much more hirable frankly to
the to the emergent company and the bigger companies you'll have a lot
of these folks that see the writing on the wall may not want to adapt as
fast as otherwise. Another way for example that you can measure this is
if you look inside your company on the productivity lift of some of
these coding assistants for people as a distribution of age. What you'll
see is the younger people leverage it way more and have way more
productivity than older folks. And I'm not saying that as an aegis
comment. I'm saying that it's an actual reflection of how people are
reacting to these tools. What you're describing is a paradigm shift. It
is a big leap. Is you know it's like when I went to college, when I took
computer science, it was object-oriented programming. It was like C++.
It was compiled languages. It was gnarly. It was nasty work. And then
you had these highle abstracted languages. And I used to remember at
Facebook, I would just get so annoyed because I was like, why is
everybody using PHP and Python? This is like not even real. But I was
one of these old lights who didn't understand that I just had to take
the leap. And what it did was it grew the top of the funnel of the
number of developers by 10x. And as a result, what you had were all of
these advancements for the internet. And I think what's happening right
now is akin to the same thing where you're going to grow the number of
developers upstream by 10x. But in order to embrace that, you just have
to jump in with two feet. And if you're very rigid in how you think the
job should be done technically, I think you're just going to get left
behind. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
