<p>Adam Grant’s "<em>Think Again</em>" offers a refreshing alternative:
the power of intellectual humility. While we often define intelligence
as the ability to think and learn, Grant argues that in a rapidly
changing world, a different cognitive skill matters just as much—the
ability to rethink and unlearn.</p>
<p>Grant challenges us to abandon the mindsets of preachers,
prosecutors, and politicians in favor of thinking like a "scientist."
The core of the first section is the concept of confident
humility—having faith in your capability while appreciating how much you
have yet to learn. We must detach our opinions from our identity. By
basing who we are on our values (e.g., generosity, freedom) rather than
our specific beliefs, we can remain open to changing our minds without
losing our sense of self.</p>
<p>How do we open other people's minds? Grant suggests that logic and
data often fail because they trigger defensiveness. Instead, we should
adopt techniques like motivational interviewing, which acts as a mirror
to help people find their own motivation to change. Effective
disagreement isn't about crushing the opponent; it's about signaling
that we are reasonable and open to evolving our own views.</p>
<p>The final section tackles how we can foster a culture of rethinking
in our communities. Grant warns against binary bias—the tendency to
simplify complex issues into two opposing sides. Complexity and nuance
are actually signals of credibility. When we showcase the "shades of
gray" and admit uncertainty, we become more persuasive, not less.</p>
<p>This book is a transformative reminder that true wisdom lies not in
the certainty of our convictions, but in the confident humility to
constantly question what we don't know. And it is worth being picked up
occasionally for self-reflection to ensure we remain open to the joy of
being wrong.</p>
<p>Here are my favorite quotes from this book:</p>
<p><strong>Individual Rethinking</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recognizing our shortcomings opens the door to doubt. As we question
our current understanding, we become curious about what information we
are missing. That search leads us to new discoveries, which in turn
maintain our humility by reinforcing how much we still have to learn. If
knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Great thinkers don't harbor doubts because they are impostors. They
maintain doubts because they know we're all partially blind and they are
committed to improving their sight. They don't boast about how much they
know; they marvel at how little they understand. They are aware that
each answer raises new questions, and the quest for knowledge is never
finished. A mark of lifelong learners is recognizing that they can learn
something from everyone they meet.</p>
<p>Arrogance leaves us blind to our weaknesses. Humility is a reflective
lens: it helps us see them clearly. Confident humility is a corrective
lens: it enables us to overcome those weaknesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Attachment. That's what keeps us from recognizing when our opinions
are off the mark and rethinking them. To unlock the joy of being wrong,
we need to detach. I've learned that two kinds of detachment are
especially useful: detaching your present from your past and detaching
your opinions from your identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who you are should be a question of what you value, not what you
believe. Values are our core principles in life - they might be
excellence and generosity, freedom and fairness, or security and
integrity. Basing your identity on these kinds of principles enables you
to remain open-minded about the best ways to advance them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The clearest sign of intellectual chemistry isn't agreeing with
someone. It's enjoying your disagreements with them. Harmony is the
pleasing arrangement of different tones, voices, or instruments, not the
combination of identical sounds. Creative tension makes beautiful
music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpersonal Rethinking</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Convincing other people to think again isn't just about making a good
argument - it's about establishing that we have the right motives in
doing so. When we concede that someone else has made a good point, we
signal that we are scientists trying to get to the truth. "Arguments are
often far more combative and adversarial than they need to be", Harish
told me, "You should be willing to listen to what someone else is saying
and give them a lot of credit for it. It makes you sound like a
reasonable person who is taking everything into account."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Being reasonable literally means that we can be reasoned with, that
we're open to evolving our views in light of logic and data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we gave them different kinds of reasons to donate, we triggered
their awareness that someone was trying to persuade them - and they
shielded themselves against it. A single line of argument feels like a
conversation; multiple lines of argument can become an onslaught.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Taken together, these techniques increase the odds that during a
disagreement, other people will abandon an overconfidence cycle and
engage in a rethinking cycle. When we point out that there are areas
where we agree and acknowledge that they have some valid points, we
model confident humility and encourage them to follow suit. When we
support our argument with a small number of cohesive, compelling
reasons, we encourage them to start doubting their own opinion. And when
we ask genuine questions, we leave them intrigued to learn more. We
don't have to convince them that we're right - we just need to open
their minds to the possibility that they might be wrong. Their natural
curiosity might do the rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Outside the lab, dismantling stereotypes and decreasing prejudice
rarely happen overnight; a key step is getting them to do some
counterfactual thinking: helping them consider what they would believe
if they were living in an alternative reality.</p>
<p>In psychology, counterfactual thinking involves imagining how the
circumstances of our lives could have unfolded differently. When we
realize how easily we could have held different stereotypes, we might be
more willing to update our views.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychologists find that many of our beliefs are cultural truisms:
widely shared, but rarely questioned. If we take a closer look at them,
we often discover that they rest on shaky foundations. Stereotypes don't
have the structural integrity of a carefully built ship. They're more
like a tower in the game of Jenga - teetering on a small number of
blocks, with some key supports missing. To knock it over, sometimes all
we need to do is give it a poke. The hope is that people will rise to
the occasion and build new beliefs on a stronger foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They developed the core principles of a practice called motivational
interviewing. The central premise is that we can rarely motivate someone
else to change. We're better off helping them find their own motivation
to change.</p>
<p>Motivational interviewing starts with an attitude of humility and
curiosity. We don't know what might motivate someone else to change, but
we're genuinely eager to find out. The goal isn't to tell people what to
do; it's to help them break out of overconfidence cycles and see new
possibilities. Our role is to hold up a mirror so they can see
themselves more clearly, and then empower them to examine their beliefs
and behaviors. That can activate a rethinking cycle, in which people
approach their own views more scientifically. They develop more humility
about their knowledge, doubt in their convictions, and curiosity about
alternative points of view.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Listening well is more than a matter of talking less. It's a set of
skills in asking and responding. It starts with showing more interest in
other people's interests rather than trying to judge their status or
prove our own. We can all get better at asking "truly curious questions
that don't have the hidden agenda of fixing, saving, advising,
convincing or correcting", and helping to "facilitate the clear
expression of another person's thoughts."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Collective Rethinking</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Binary bias is a basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by
simplifying a complex continuum into two categories. To paraphrase the
humorist Robert Benchley, there are two kinds of people: those who
divide the world into two kinds of people, and those who don't.</p>
<p>An antidote to this proclivity is complexifying: showcasing the range
of perspectives on a given topic. We might believe we're making progress
by discussing hot-button issues as two sides of a coin, but people are
actually more inclined to think again if we present these topics through
the many lenses of a prism. To borrow a phrase from Walt Whitman, it
takes a multitude of views to help people realize that they too contain
multitudes.</p>
<p>A dose of complexity can disrupt overconfidence cycles and spur
rethinking cycles. It gives us more humility about our knowledge and
more doubts about our opinions, and it can make us curious enough to
discover information we were lacking.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This thorny issue is a natural place to explore how we can bring more
complexity into our conversations. Fundamentally, that involves drawing
attention to the nuances that often get overlooked. It starts with
seeking and spotlighting shades of gray.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we are reading, listening, or watching, we can learn to
recognize complexity as a signal of credibility.</p>
<p>Multiple experiments have shown that when experts express doubt, they
become more persuasive. When someone knowledgeable admits uncertainty,
it surprises people, and they end up paying more attention to the
substance of the argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In a series of experiments, psychologists demonstrated that when news
reports about science included caveats, they succeeded in capturing
readers' interest and keeping their minds open.</p>
<p>New research reveals that people are more likely to promote diversity
and inclusion when the message is more nuanced (and more accurate).
Acknowledging complexity doesn't make speakers and writers less
convincing; it makes them more credible. It doesn't lose viewers and
readers; it maintains their engagement while stoking their
curiosity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What stands in the way of rethinking isn't the expression of emotion;
it's a restricted range of emotion.</p>
</blockquote>
