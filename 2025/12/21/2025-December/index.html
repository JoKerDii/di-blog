<p><em>Lastly, the crux of the tweet: "Optimistic contrarians are the
rarest breed." This speaks to individuals who possess the courage to
deviate from the mainstream not for the sake of contrariness, but driven
by genuine belief in a different, often better vision. More importantly,
they do this with optimism. Unlike cynics, optimistic contrarians see
the potential in what others dismiss. They are hopeful about their
divergent views, even in the face of criticism or skepticism. They
combine the audacity to think differently with the belief that their
path, though less traveled, is full of promise.</em></p>

[<a

</blockquote>
<p>The three frameworks Dan Koe lays out are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Beginner – The Micro Story</strong></p>
<p>This is meant for fast articulation in short-form writing or
speech.</p>
<p>Best for: quick clarity and attention</p>
<p>A simple storytelling structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem – state a relatable problem</li>
<li>Amplify – show the negative consequences if it’s not solved</li>
<li>Solution – present the insight or fix</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Intermediate – The Pyramid Principle</strong></p>
<p>This works especially well for podcasts, presentations, and longer
explanations.</p>
<p>Best for: structured thinking and credibility</p>
<p>A logic-first communication framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the main idea or conclusion</li>
<li>Support it with 3–5 key arguments</li>
<li>Back those up with evidence, examples, or data</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Advanced – Cross-Domain Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>This is best suited for newsletters, essays, talks, or long-form
content.</p>
<p>Best for: originality and thought leadership</p>
<p>A deeper, more original structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem + amplify (clear, relatable setup)</li>
<li>Cross-domain synthesis (borrow concepts from other fields to explain
the idea)</li>
<li>Unique process or solution (your own framework or steps)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><em>The future belongs to those who can filter signal from noise.

becomes the skill.</em></p>
<p><em>The ability to learn any skill fast, however, will.</em></p>
<p><em>Devon Eriksen talks about the “liberating arts,” the skills that
free people have always needed to act on their own behalf:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Logic</strong>: deriving truth from known

<li><em><strong>Statistics</strong>: understanding the implications of
data</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Rhetoric</strong>: persuading, and spotting persuasion
tactics</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Research</strong>: gathering information on unknown
subjects</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Psychology</strong>: discerning the true motives of
yourself and others</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Investment</strong>: managing and growing
assets</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Agency</strong>: deciding what to pursue and acting
without permission</em></li>

<p><em>If your thoughts are average, they can be compressed.</em></p>
<p><em>If your ideas are derivative, they can be predicted.</em></p>
<p><em>If your personality is shaped by trends, you can be simulated —
and eventually replaced.</em></p>
<p><em>The more you become like everyone else, the more you
disappear.</em></p>
<p><em>To be incompressible is to break the pattern. To do something
that hasn’t been done. To think what hasn’t been thought. To speak in a
voice that’s unmistakably yours.</em></p>
<p><em>It means cultivating taste that isn’t algorithmic.</em></p>
<p><em>It means being boring to the AI and fascinating to the
human.</em></p>
<p><em>Most of all, incompressibility requires solitude. Silence.
Reflection.</em></p>
<p><em>Space from the noise so you can remember who you are when no one
is watching.</em></p>

<p><em>Naval’s line, “If you don’t commit to meaningful work, life will
fill your time with busywork,” is a reminder of a quiet truth: your time
will never stay empty. Something will always come in. The choice is
whether it’s chosen by you, or assigned to you by circumstance,
employers, algorithms, or the thousand tiny demands that chip away at
your attention.</em></p>
<p><em>Meaningful work, on the other hand, rarely arrives disguised as
something urgent. It doesn’t ping, buzz, or demand anything. It
whispers. It waits. It requires intention. It asks you to choose it
repeatedly, often against comfort, against convenience, against the easy
path. It’s the book unwritten, the skill unmastered, the company
unstarted, the craft unrefined. The things that make your life bigger
but don’t shout for your attention.</em></p>

<p><strong>How to fix your entire life in 1 day - Dan Koe</strong>
[Link]</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>You aren't where you want to be because you aren't the
person who would be there.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>You aren't where you want to be because you don't want to
be there.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>You aren't where you want to be because you are afraid to
be there.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The life you want lies within a specific level of
mind.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intelligence is the ability to get what you want out of
life.</strong></p>
<p>Cybernetics illustrates the properties of intelligent systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>To have a goal.</li>
<li>Act toward that goal.</li>
<li>Sense where you are.</li>
<li>Compare it to the goal.</li>
<li>And act again based on that feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>To become more intelligent, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reject the known path</li>
<li>Dive into the unknown</li>
<li>Set new, higher goals to expand your mind</li>
<li>Embrace the chaos and allow for growth</li>
<li>Study the generalized principles of nature</li>
<li>Become a deep generalist</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>How to launch a completely new life in one
day</strong></p>
<p>Three phases that people go through to successfully flip their
identity:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dissonance – They feel like they don’t belong in their current life,
and become sufficiently fed up with their lack of progress.</li>
<li>Uncertainty – They don’t know what comes next, so they either
experiment or get lost and feel worse.</li>
<li>Discovery – They discover what they want to pursue and make 6 years
of progress in 6 months.</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions make you aware of the pain in your current life:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What is the dull and persistent dissatisfaction you've learned to
live with? Not the deep suffering but what you've learned to tolerate.
(if you don't hate it, you will tolerate it)</li>
<li>What do you complain about repeatedly but never actually change?
Write down the three complaints you've voiced most often in the past
year.</li>
<li>For each complaint: what would someone who watched your behavior
(not your words) conclude that you actually want?</li>
<li>What truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit to
someone you deeply respect?</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions to come up with your anti vision - a brutal awareness of
the life you dod not want to live:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If absolutely nothing changes for the next five years, describe an
average Tuesday. Where do you wake up? What does your body feel like?
What’s the first thing you think about? Who’s around you? What do you do
between 9am and 6pm? How do you feel at 10pm?</li>
<li>Now do it but for ten years. What have you missed? What
opportunities closed? Who gave up on you? What do people say about you
when you’re not in the room?</li>
<li>You’re at the end of your life. You lived the safe version. You
never broke the pattern. What was the cost? What did you never let
yourself feel, try, or become?</li>
<li>Who in your life is already living the future you just described?
Someone five, ten, twenty years ahead on the same trajectory? What do
you feel when you think about becoming them?</li>
<li>What identity would you have to give up to actually change? (”I am
the type of person who...”) What would it cost you socially to no longer
be that person?</li>
<li>What is the most embarrassing reason you haven’t changed? The one
that makes you sound weak, scared, or lazy rather than reasonable?</li>
<li>If your current behavior is a form of self-protection, what exactly
are you protecting? And what is that protection costing you?</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions to create a minimum viable vision:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Forget practicality for a minute. If you could snap your fingers and
be living a different life in three years, not what’s realistic, what
you actually <em>want</em>? What does an average Tuesday look like? Same
level of detail as question 5.</li>
<li>What would you have to believe about yourself for that life to feel
natural rather than forced? Write the identity statement: “I am the type
of person who...”</li>
<li>What is one thing you would do this week if you were already that
person?</li>
</ol>
<p>Random questions throughout the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>11:00am: What am I avoiding right now by doing what I’m doing?</li>
<li>1:30pm: If someone filmed the last two hours, what would they
conclude I want from my life?</li>
<li>3:15pm: Am I moving toward the life I hate or the life I want?</li>
<li>5:00pm: What’s the most important thing I’m pretending isn’t
important?</li>
<li>7:30pm: What did I do today out of identity protection rather than
genuine desire? (Hint: it’s most things you do)</li>
<li>9:00pm: When did I feel most alive today? When did I feel most
dead?</li>
<li>What would change if I stopped needing people to see me as [the
identity you wrote in question 10]?</li>
<li>Where in my life am I trading aliveness for safety?</li>
<li>What’s the smallest version of the person I want to become that I
could be tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to synthesize insights:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>After today, what feels most true about why you’ve been stuck?</li>
<li>What is the actual enemy? Name it clearly. Not circumstances. Not
other people. The internal pattern or belief that has been running the
show.</li>
<li>Write a single sentence that captures what you refuse to let your
life become. This is your anti-vision compressed. It should make you
feel something when you read it.</li>
<li>Write a single sentence that captures what you’re building toward,
knowing it will evolve. This is your vision MVP.</li>
</ol>
<p>To create goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One-year lens: What would have to be true in one year for you to
know you’ve broken the old pattern? One concrete thing.</li>
<li>One-month lens: What would have to be true in one month for the
one-year lens to remain possible?</li>
<li>Daily lens: What are 2-3 actions you can timeblock tomorrow that the
person you’re becoming would simply do?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Turn your life into a video game</strong></p>
<p>Six components that lead to a good life:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-vision</strong> – What is the bane of my existence, or
the life I never want to experience again?</li>
<li><strong>Vision</strong> – What is the ideal life that I think I want
and can improve as I work toward it?</li>
<li><strong>1 year goal</strong> – What will my life look like in 1 year
time, and is that closer to the life I want?</li>
<li><strong>1 month project</strong> – What do I need to learn? What
skills do I need to acquire? What can I build that will move me closer
to the one year goal?</li>
<li><strong>Daily levers</strong> – What are the priority, needle-moving
tasks that bring my project closer to completion?</li>
<li><strong>Constraints</strong> – What am I not willing to sacrifice to
achieve my vision from the ground up?</li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong><em>2025 was the year the comfortable assumptions got
stress-tested.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>“Just scale it”?</strong> DeepSeek proved architectural
efficiency could match brute-force compute – and wiped a trillion
dollars off the market.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>“Distribution is all you need”?</strong> Despite
Microsoft’s insane lead start, OpenAI’s clear consumer and mindshare
lead, and Google’s incredible distribution, and Anthropic still beat
them all in the enterprise and coding wars.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>“America leads open source”?</strong> I count nine
competitive Chinese model releases in 2025. Meta shipped two (and
Behemoth is still MIA).</em></li>
<li><em><strong>“Bigger models = better models”?</strong>
Mixture-of-experts, inference-time compute, and distillation ate that
thesis alive.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>What actually mattered</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Great products beat distribution</em></li>
<li><em>Efficiency mattered more than scale</em></li>

<p>The global payments industry is moving away from harmonisation and
toward persistent fragmentation. This shift is structural—not
temporary—and banks must fundamentally rethink their payment
infrastructures to remain competitive. Fragmentation is structural and
enduring. Banks that succeed will be those that embrace divergence,
modernise their core payment architectures, and treat flexibility as a
strategic advantage rather than a cost burden.</p>

<p><strong>How To Ask for Support from Senior Leaders - Yue
Zhao</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.yuezhao.coach/p/how-to-help-your-leaders-help-you">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1) Mindset Shift</strong>: People often avoid asking for help
because they see it as a sign of weakness. The author learned that
asking for help is an <em>essential leadership skill</em> — especially
when challenges exceed your control or expertise.</p>
<p><strong>2) When to Ask for Help</strong></p>
<p>You should consider asking for help when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The challenge is outside your area of expertise.</li>
<li>It requires coordination across teams you don’t control.</li>
<li>You need exceptions or decisions from leaders outside your chain of
command.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general rule: ask earlier rather than later — problems grow if
unaddressed.</p>
<p><strong>3) Types of Help to Ask For</strong></p>
<p>The article breaks down <em>effective asks</em> into levels of
involvement a leader might provide:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Be a Sounding Board</strong> — light request: listen and
give perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Give Air Cover</strong> — leader supports you publicly in
meetings or when there’s pushback.</li>
<li><strong>Be a Messenger</strong> — leader helps deliver messages you
can’t reach as easily.</li>
<li><strong>Fight With Me</strong> — leader actively advocates or argues
on your behalf (highest effort).</li>
</ol>
<p>The author suggests that asking for air cover is often the best
default: It’s low-effort for the leader and lets you drive the work
while they back you up.</p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Execution isn’t the bottleneck; unclear strategy
is.</strong>: Teams over-execute when strategy isn’t explicit, forcing
constant validation, rework, and reactive prioritization.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of strategy clarity creates hidden time
leaks.</strong>: Without a clear strategic “yes,” leaders and teams
struggle to say no—resulting in fragmented effort and slow
decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>An imperfect strategy is better than a silent one.</strong>:
Strategy doesn’t need to be complete to be effective; even partial
clarity reduces noise and accelerates alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy must function as a system, not a
document.</strong>: Value comes from embedding strategy into everyday
decisions, tradeoffs, and communication—not from standalone
artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived productivity can mask lack of progress.</strong>:
Teams can ship continuously while failing to move the business forward
if work isn’t anchored to a shared direction.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy is ultimately a leadership communication
discipline.</strong>: Clear, consistently reinforced strategy enables
faster decisions, greater autonomy, and compounding momentum.</li>

<p>AI stops being something you ask, and becomes something that
does.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interfaces: chat → action</li>
<li>Design: human-first → agent-first</li>
<li>Work: assistance → execution</li>
</ul>
<p>Big Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>From prompts to action:</strong> AI interfaces are moving
beyond chat boxes toward agents that proactively execute tasks and
workflows on users’ behalf, acting more like autonomous employees than
tools you query.</li>
<li><strong>From human-readable to agent-readable software:</strong>
Software, content, and workflows will increasingly be designed to be
machine-legible first, enabling agents to reliably navigate, interpret,
and operate systems without brittle prompting.</li>
<li><strong>From demos to deployable voice agents:</strong> Voice AI is
crossing a threshold from novelty to production-ready systems, becoming
practical in domains like healthcare, finance, recruiting, and consumer
wellness due to improved reliability and integration.</li>

legacy systems with AI-native, unified infrastructure unlocks parallel
workflows, cleaner data, and structurally higher margins.</li>
<li><strong>The Dynamic Agent Layer</strong>: Static systems of record
will be overtaken by a dynamic agent layer where AI agents actively

<p>Ray Dalio is talking about how money works, why bubbles are
inevitable, and how to think across cycles rather than chase
narratives.</p>
<p>Takeaways - what Ray Dalio explicitly believes or argues in this
episode:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Money ≠ Wealth</strong></p>
<p>Money is not real wealth; it is a claim on wealth. Wealth is real
purchasing power backed by: 1) Goods, 2) Services, 3) Productivity.
Printing money does not create wealth—it only redistributes claims on
existing wealth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Money Has Two Conflicting Functions</strong></p>
<p>Dalio defines money as: A medium of exchange; A store of wealth</p>
<p>"When debt is high and governments intervene, money often fails at
being a store of wealth." This conflict explains: 1) Inflation, 2)
Currency debasement, 3) Asset bubbles</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Debt Cycles Drive Everything</strong></p>
<p>Economies move in long-term debt cycles (50–100 years). Excessive
debt forces governments into a corner: 1) Raise taxes, 2) Cut spending,
3) Print money. Historically, they always print.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Gold Standard Ending Was a Regime Shift</strong></p>
<p>Nixon ending the gold standard (1971) permanently changed money.
Since then: 1) Money is a policy tool, not a constraint. 2) Governments
can promise more than they can actually deliver. This makes currency
risk unavoidable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bubbles Are Created by Easy Money</strong></p>
<p>Bubbles form when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money creation outpaces real economic growth</li>
<li>People extrapolate recent gains indefinitely</li>
<li>Leverage increases faster than income</li>
</ul>
<p>Dalio sees bubbles as mechanical, not moral failures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leverage Is the Silent Killer</strong></p>
<p>Most people underestimate leverage risk. Leverage: 1) Magnifies
gains, 2) Destroys you quickly when wrong</p>
<p>Liquidity disappears precisely when you need it most.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wealth Preservation &gt; Wealth Maximization</strong></p>
<p>Dalio emphasizes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Surviving bad regimes matters more than winning good
ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Losing 50% requires a 100% gain to recover.</p></li>
<li><p>The biggest mistake investors make is
over-concentration.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Diversification Is Not About Asset Count</strong></p>
<p>True diversification means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exposure to uncorrelated return drivers</p></li>
<li><p>Assets that respond differently to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Growth</p></li>
<li><p>Inflation</p></li>
<li><p>Deflation</p></li>
<li><p>Political stress</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Holding many similar assets ≠ diversification.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If You Can’t Beat the Market, Don’t Try</strong></p>
<p>Most people should not trade or time markets. Dalio believes: 1)
Humility beats confidence, 2) Process beats prediction</p>
<p>Portfolio construction matters more than asset selection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Productive Assets Are the Best Long-Term Store of
Wealth</strong></p>
<p>Dalio prefers assets that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Generate cash flows</p></li>
<li><p>Adapt to inflation</p></li>
<li><p>Represent real economic activity</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples: 1) Businesses, 2) Innovation, 3) Human capital</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gold Has a Role — But It’s Not Everything</strong></p>
<p>Gold is a hedge against: 1) Currency debasement, 2) Political
disorder. But it does not produce income. It should be part of a
portfolio, not the portfolio.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Crypto Is Unproven as a Long-Term Store of
Wealth</strong></p>
<p>Dalio’s view is cautious, not dismissive: Crypto has some
store-of-value characteristics, but: 1) No long multi-cycle history, 2)
Regulatory and political uncertainty.</p>
<p>He treats it as speculative diversification, not core
wealth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Real Estate Is Politically Vulnerable</strong></p>
<p>Real estate is easy to: 1) Tax, 2) Regulate, 3) Seize. Investors
underestimate political risk in immovable assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prediction Is Less Valuable Than Understanding
Systems</strong></p>
<p>Dalio does not believe in point forecasts. He believes in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cause–effect relationships</p></li>
<li><p>Scenario thinking</p></li>
<li><p>Probabilities, not certainties</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Five Forces Drive History</strong></p>
<p>Dalio believes every country’s trajectory is shaped by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Debt &amp; money</li>
<li>Internal conflict</li>
<li>External conflict</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Acts of nature</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>​ Ignore any one of these and your analysis is incomplete.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Technology Is the Ultimate Long-Term Wealth
Driver</strong></p>
<p>Innovation increases productivity. Productivity is the foundation of
rising living standards. Countries that innovate absorb shocks better
than those that don’t.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psychology Determines Success More Than
Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>Successful investors share:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Humility</p></li>
<li><p>Curiosity</p></li>
<li><p>Willingness to be wrong</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to learn from pain</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>​ Ego is the enemy of compounding.</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Learning Comes From Proximity</strong></p>
<p>The fastest way to learn is to be near: 1) Great thinkers, 2) Great
decision-makers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wealth Without Purpose Is Empty</strong></p>
<p>Dalio believes: 1) Legacy matters more than net worth, 2) Passing
knowledge forward is the highest form of wealth, 3) Systems and ideas
outlast money.</p></li>
