What Actually Needed Building - First Round</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.firstround.com/ai/notion">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Success came from reaching the right accounts at the right time, not
better email copy. So the real problem wasn’t writing better emails, or
automating research, it was account prioritization driven by product
signals.</p>
<p>What They Built:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Papercut fix: A Chrome extension that eliminated constant
copy-pasting across tools (LinkedIn, Salesforce, Notion, Outreach).
Adopted by almost the entire sales team within weeks.</li>
<li>New bet (high impact): “Salestino Bot” - An internal AI system that
detects product usage signals (e.g., new workspace creation), decides
when a rep should reach out, automates company/person research using a
constrained web agent, drafts customized outreach emails (with humans in
the loop), and delivered via Slack in a single workflow.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>In a secretive "Manhattan Project" led by Huawei, China built a
prototype EUV machine by recruiting former ASML engineers, many of whom
worked under aliases to maintain security. Although the prototype
generates the necessary light, it has not yet produced working chips due
to challenges in replicating high-precision optical systems. Operational
production is now targeted for 2030, suggesting China is closing the
technology gap faster than analysts anticipated.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>AI coding agents are fundamentally changing the build-vs-buy
decision, making it increasingly viable for technically capable
organizations to replace many SaaS products with internally built,
agent-assisted tools—thereby threatening demand, renewals, and expansion
economics for large parts of the SaaS industry.</p>

<p><em>The more I’ve done it, the more I realize that what most people
think of as the hard parts of hiring—asking just the right question that
catches the candidate off guard, defining the role correctly, assessing
the person’s skills—are less important than a more basic task: how do
you see someone, including yourself, clearly?</em></p>
<p><strong>― What’s going on here, with this human? - Graham

<p><strong>The Three-Part Framework for Seeing People
Clearly</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Seeing Your Reflection in the Window
(Self-Awareness)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can’t see others clearly unless you see your own biases,
projections, and triggers.</p></li>
<li><p>Interviews are co-created interactions; your tone, assumptions,
and values shape how the other person shows up.</p></li>
<li><p>Personality frameworks (Myers–Briggs, Big Five, self-monitoring,
etc.) are most useful when applied to yourself first.</p></li>
<li><p>Use multiple frameworks to avoid becoming trapped by a single
lens.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key idea:</strong> Misjudgment often comes from mistaking
your own internal reactions for objective insight.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Seeing the Elephants in the Room (Unconscious
Drivers)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Borrowing from Jonathan Haidt: each person has a rider (conscious
narrative) and an elephant (unconscious motivations). Interviews mostly
capture the rider; references reveal the elephant.</p></li>
<li><p>Espoused beliefs ≠ actual behavior (“espoused theory” vs. “theory
in use”).</p></li>
<li><p>High-quality reference checks are often 5–10x more valuable than
interviews, especially from trusted, calibrated observers.</p></li>
<li><p>The best signal often comes from:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tone of a reference</li>
<li>“Table-pounding” enthusiasm</li>
<li>The dog that doesn’t bark (what’s conspicuously missing)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>​ <strong>Key idea:</strong> Humility about your limited perception is
a prerequisite for accuracy.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Seeing the Water (Context and Ecosystem)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no such thing as an “A player” in the
abstract—performance is context-dependent.</p></li>
<li><p>People thrive or fail based on subtle environmental factors:
culture, incentives, belief loops, and feedback structures.</p></li>
<li><p>Moving someone to a new ecosystem is risky; strengths in one
context can become weaknesses in another.</p></li>
<li><p>Belief from leaders and teammates can create powerful positive
feedback loops.</p></li>
<li><p>Hiring should focus on fit between person and environment, not
just raw talent.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>​ <strong>Key idea:</strong> To understand someone, you must
understand the system they came from—and the one you’re putting them
into.</p>

<p><strong>Claude’s Constitution - Anthropic</strong> [<a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.anthropic.com/constitution">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This constitution is trying to define an AI that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Has internalized values, not just filters</p></li>
<li><p>Balances:</p>
<ul>
<li>User benefit</li>
<li>Societal impact</li>
<li>Company constraints</li>
<li>Long-term safety</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Operates more like a moral agent under supervision than a pure
tool</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Claude’s Constitution is not a dataset of examples. It’s a normative
specification — a written set of values, priorities, and decision
heuristics that Anthropic uses to shape Claude’s behavior. It’s one of
the clearest examples of value-based alignment framing, rather than just
policy enforcement.</p>

<p>Today’s models are powerful with words and patterns, but they don’t
truly understand the 3D, physical, dynamic world the way humans do. To
unlock robotics, scientific discovery, immersive creativity, and
real-world interaction, AI needs world models — systems that can
represent and reason about spaces, objects, physics, and change over
time.</p>

<p>In the AI era, the winners aren’t specialists — they’re people who
turn their unique mix of interests into a public body of work and build
systems around their own development.</p>

<p>The merger supports Musk’s vision of putting AI data centers in
space, using solar power to cut energy costs for AI training and
inference. It would tightly integrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rockets + satellite infrastructure (SpaceX/Starlink/Starshield)</li>
<li>AI models + compute (xAI, Grok, Colossus supercomputer)</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It can be useful in a few ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It saves cognitive effort. Letting an AI agent handle it via voice
means fewer screens, fewer steps, less mental load.</li>
<li>It makes AI do something real. This isn’t a chatbot answering FAQs.
With Visa’s agentic payments, AI can complete a transaction end-to-end
inside regulated rails.</li>
<li>Security scales better than humans. Tokenization and network-level
controls reduce exposure compared to people re-entering card details or
storing them unsafely.</li>
<li>It sets a pattern, not just a feature. If it works for service
charges, the same model extends to utilities, subscriptions, fees,
renewals—basically all the financial chores people hate.</li>
<li>Voice is the unlock. For accessibility, multitasking, and
mobile-first users, voice turns payments from a “task” into a quick
interaction.</li>

<p>Key points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) became the big
new training stage in 2025.</li>
<li>LLMs are not evolving minds like humans or animals. They’re alien,
jagged intelligences optimized for text imitation and reward hacking,
not survival.</li>
<li>Tools like Cursor revealed a new class of applications. These apps
1) engineer context carefully, 2) orchestrate many model calls into
workflows, 3) provide GUIs and autonomy controls, 4) turn general models
into usable professionals.</li>
<li>Agents feel more powerful when they’re local “spirits” living on
your machine, not cloud demos.</li>
<li>Natural-language programming crossed a threshold in 2025. Software
creation is being radically democratized.</li>
<li>The future UI of AI won’t be text. The GUI for AI is still mostly
unbuilt.</li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>Budget shifts from labor to AI spending in 2026</li>

<li><p>Product Market Fit (PMF) now needs to be re-earned every ~3
months because models, capabilities, and user expectations shift
constantly—even at massive scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Elena says only ~30–40% of what she learned over 20 years
(including at Miro, Dropbox, and Amplitude) still applies to AI
companies.</p></li>
<li><p>At Lovable, ~95% of growth comes from shipping new
features/products. Traditional conversion optimization contributes very
little in fast-moving AI markets.</p></li>
<li><p>Rapid shipping + loud communication (engineers announcing
updates, founders posting progress daily) keeps users engaged and
competitors behind.</p></li>
<li><p>Free usage is marketing not cost. Lovable gives away credits,
sponsors hackathons, and funds events. Expensive inference is treated as
CAC, fueling word-of-mouth.</p></li>
<li><p>Influencers beat paid ads (by ~10x). Short videos showing real
product capabilities outperform traditional paid advertising. Demo &gt;
messaging.</p></li>
<li><p>MVP → “Minimum Lovable Product”. If it doesn’t delight, people
won’t share it. Word of mouth is the primary growth engine.</p></li>
<li><p>Community is a core growth lever. Large, active communities (like
Lovable’s massive Discord) drive retention, support, and organic
growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Hire for chaos tolerance. High-agency people—AI-native grads and
ex-founders—thrive where roles, roadmaps, and clarity are constantly
shifting.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypergrowth doesn’t require burnout. Elena emphasizes strict
boundaries: protected family time, gym time, and rejecting hustle
culture as a status symbol.</p></li>

<p>The article argues that Apple’s seemingly slow approach to AI is a
deliberate strategy, not a failure. While rivals like Google and Meta
have spent hundreds of billions building AI infrastructure, Apple has
conserved cash—retaining roughly $130 billion—giving it flexibility to
invest, acquire, or pivot in 2026.</p>

<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enterprises prefer buying over building: 76% of enterprise AI use
cases are purchased, not built (up from a near 50/50 split in 2024).
Off-the-shelf AI products reach production faster and deliver clearer
ROI. Internal builds still exist, but are slower and harder to
operationalize.</li>
<li>AI buyers are highly intentional: 47% of AI pilots convert to
production, vs 25% for traditional SaaS. Enterprises explore many use
cases, but only fund those with near-term productivity or cost
impact.</li>
<li>Product-led growth (PLG) is the dominant adoption motion.
Individuals, not executives, are pulling AI into enterprises.</li>
<li>Startups are beating incumbents in applications. AI-native speed
beats distribution advantages. Startups capture 63% of AI application
revenue. They win by shipping faster, owning new workflows (not legacy
systems), and leveraging PLG flywheels.</li>
<li>Applications are the largest spend category. AI value shows up
fastest where workflows are repetitive, text-heavy, and measurable.</li>
<li>Anthropic is winning the enterprise LLM war. Coding performance =
enterprise dominance.</li>
<li>Open-source LLMs lag in the enterprise. Enterprises prefer closed
models for reliability, support, and governance. Meanwhile, startups and
developers increasingly use Chinese open-source models (Qwen, DeepSeek).
Innovation happens in open ecosystems; enterprises remain
risk-averse.</li>
<li>Only 16% of enterprise deployments qualify as real agents.
Architecture maturity lags model capability.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Good points mentioned by Marques Brownlee:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Velocity Trap: Polish vs. Pace</p>
<p>Apple’s traditional "slow and steady" approach—waiting for a category
to mature before entering with a polished product—may be incompatible
with AI. Unlike hardware, AI improves through real-world iteration and
constant data loops. By prioritizing perfection and long release cycles,
Apple risks falling behind competitors who are learning and evolving in
real-time.</p></li>
<li><p>The Execution &amp; Credibility Gap</p>
<p>While "Apple Intelligence" is conceptually sound (focusing on privacy
and deep OS integration), there is a growing disconnect between
marketing and reality. Much of Apple’s vision remains aspirational and
unproven, leading to a "credibility gap." Relying on future-dated AI
features to drive current hardware sales creates a significant trust
risk if the eventual rollout doesn't meet the high bar set by the
demos.</p></li>
<li><p>Cultural Rigidity in a Fluid Market</p>
<p>The AI shift is as much a cultural test as a technical one. Apple’s
core pillars—secrecy, privacy-first design, and walled-garden
ecosystems—are now friction points in an industry that rewards open
iteration and speed. While Apple still possesses massive advantages in
silicon and distribution, its margin for error is slimmer than ever
because AI is a foundational platform shift, not just a new feature
set.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Everything Is Becoming Supply-Driven (and That Breaks Old
Intuitions)</p>
<p>Historically, markets were demand-constrained; now they are
increasingly supply-unconstrained due to software, AI, and cloud. This
is why traditional TAM / market sizing frameworks are fundamentally
broken. If you remove constraints, human demand is far larger than
economists ever modeled.</p></li>
<li><p>AI Is a General-Purpose Force Multiplier</p>
<p>AI is not “one more sector” — it’s a universal problem solver. This
creates second-order effects across every industry, not just tech.
Companies that treat AI as a feature will lose to those that treat it as
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Cloud + Software Create 10× Outcomes</p>
<p>Databricks is a canonical example: when compute, storage, and tooling
scale together, you get nonlinear gains. Once platforms reach sufficient
abstraction, entire new categories appear that were impossible before.
Step-change technologies don’t improve things linearly — they rewrite
what’s possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Intangibles Are the New Moat</p>
<p>Brand, reputation, trust, and narrative now matter more than physical
assets. In a world of infinite supply, attention and belief become the
scarce resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Original Thinkers with Conviction Win</p>
<p>The future belongs to people who combine: original ideas, moral
clarity, willingness to take public criticism (“take arrows”). Consensus
thinking is structurally disadvantaged in exponential eras.</p></li>
<li><p>Media Has Shifted from Gatekeepers to Creators</p>
<p>When creators own distribution, creativity explodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Reputation Is a First-Class Economic Asset</p>
<p>In decentralized systems, there is no central arbiter of quality.
Reputation becomes: The hiring signal, The funding signal, The
distribution advantage.</p></li>
<li><p>Great Companies Are Built by Dreamers, Not Committees</p>
<p>a16z tries to invert this by protecting founders’ psychological
safety and ambition. The job is to scale belief without killing the
dream.</p></li>
<li><p>Founders Need Confidence, Not Just Intelligence</p>
<p>Turning inventors into CEOs requires emotional reinforcement, not
just advice.</p></li>
<li><p>Autonomy Beats Control</p>
<p>a16z is structured as semi-autonomous teams rather than a centralized
hierarchy. This mirrors how startups scale effectively: high trust, high
accountability, low friction.</p></li>

<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AI is the biggest tech shift is bigger than PCs, the internet, or
mobile. Despite the hype, most industries have not reorganized around AI
yet. Current adoption is surface-level (tools, copilots), not structural
(AI-native workflows).</p></li>
<li><p>The cost of intelligence is collapsing. AI is fundamentally
different because intelligence becomes cheap and abundant. As costs
fall, usage explodes — even if revenue models lag. This creates
temporary distortions: high burn, unclear margins, massive upside.
Falling intelligence costs will unlock entirely new markets, not just
improve existing ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Many AI companies look “unprofitable” by traditional standards.
What matters is whether cost curves bend faster than price curves.
Infrastructure advantages (GPUs, clusters) are real but short-lived. You
back companies where learning speed beats depreciation speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Pricing will shift from SaaS to usage- and value-based. Flat SaaS
pricing breaks when marginal intelligence cost trends toward zero. AI
pricing will resemble: 1) cloud compute; 2) utilities; 3)
consumption-based services. Value-based pricing becomes feasible because
AI output is measurable.</p></li>
<li><p>Open vs. closed is not a winner-take-all debate. Multiple
contradictory strategies can succeed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Closed models: 1) better control, 2) clearer monetization, 3) tighter
safety</p>
<p>Open models: 1) faster diffusion, 2) ecosystem leverage, 3)
geopolitical resilience</p></li>
<li><p>Incumbents and startups have different, real advantages. Outcomes
depend on how deeply AI rewrites the workflow.</p></li>
<li><p>Most disruption happens at the task level, not the job title.
Productivity gains are uneven and socially destabilizing. Adoption
depends more on human systems than model capability. Technology moves
faster than institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Venture strategy must embrace contradictions. a16z deliberately
backs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>open and closed</p></li>
<li><p>big models and small models</p></li>
<li><p>infrastructure and applications</p></li>
<li><p>Because uncertainty is structural, not temporary.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<p>Takeways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Satya frames AI not as “chatbots” but as a progression of work
interfaces. The real value isn’t “fun AI,” it’s AI that completes
multi-step business tasks inside workflows. Microsoft is focused on
closing the gap between 'cool demo' and 'actual business process
transformation'.</p></li>
<li><p>He subtly pushes back on the “AI replaces workers” narrative. His
framing is that AI is productivity density, not just removal, meaning
more output per employee, faster cycle times, and more ambitious
projects.</p></li>
<li><p>He sees the future as not just one assistant, but many
domain-specific agents. These agents will use enterprise data, work
across tools (M365, Dynamics, GitHub, etc.), and handle business
processes, not just prompts.</p></li>
<li><p>Microsoft’s edge is NOT owning the best foundation model.
It’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribution (Windows, Office, Azure)</li>
<li>Enterprise trust</li>
<li>Identity, security, compliance</li>
<li>Data layer</li>
<li>Developer ecosystem</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>AI is a full tech stack competition. He frames AI competition as
not model vs model, but national + ecosystem tech stacks.</p>
<p>Winning stack = Compute + Models + Apps + Distribution + Developers +
Data</p></li>
<li><p>He doesn’t say SaaS dies. SaaS UI becomes agent-accessible
capability surfaces. Therefore, the UI is less important, APIs,
workflows, and data models become key, and software becomes “actionable
services for agents”.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>U.S. healthcare isn’t failing because of lack of talent or
technology — it’s failing because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Incentives reward procedures, billing complexity, and
intermediaries</p></li>
<li><p>Prevention and long-term outcomes are underpaid</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucratic and payment layers distort decisions</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Fraud is not marginal — it’s structural and industrial-scale.
Includes phantom billing, fake clinics, and organized rings. Fraud
inflates prices and drains resources from real care</p></li>
<li><p>The bottleneck in healthcare isn’t knowledge — it’s access +
navigation.</p>
<p>AI will: Do triage; Guide patients before they see doctors;
Standardize care quality; Reduce unnecessary specialist visits. The big
shift will be from doctor-centered care to data/AI-guided care. Doctors
become escalation points, not the front door.</p></li>
<li><p>Healthcare reflects upstream social failures. Healthcare costs
are downstream of: Addiction; Mental health breakdowns; Social
instability; Border and population pressures.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Musk’s stance is that transformative AI is very close. Superhuman AI
as an engineering inevitability. Timeline measured in years, not
decades. The key limiter now being infrastructure (chips, power) more
than theory.</li>
<li>AI risk is structural, not Hollywood. He’s not focused on evil
robots; he worries about: Systems optimizing for goals misaligned with
human intent; Intelligence that becomes strategically beyond human
control; Power concentration in a few actors. The danger comes from
competence without alignment, not malice.</li>
<li>He frames AI as a civilization-level strategic asset. The US–China
competition is inevitable. Export controls slow but don’t stop
capability. Whoever leads in AI shapes military, economic, and political
leverage. AI dominance may matter more than nuclear or industrial
dominance did.</li>
<li>Intelligence scaling = energy scaling. AI data centers are seen as
industrial-scale electricity consumers, dependent on massive grid
expansion, tightly linked to storage + renewables.</li>
<li>Physical AI (robots) will outscale digital AI in impact. He sees
humanoid robots (Optimus) as the path to automating real-world labor,
more economically transformative than software alone, and potentially
more numerous than humans. The biggest value creation isn’t chatbots —
it’s AI in bodies.</li>
<li>He argues AI + robotics will outperform humans at most jobs,
collapse the economic necessity of labor, and shift society toward
abundance of goods/services. The core future problem isn’t unemployment
— it’s purpose and meaning in a post-labor world.</li>
<li>Concentrated superintelligence is more dangerous than distributed
superintelligence.</li>
<li>We’re in a civilization transition, not a tech cycle. This is a
species-level turning point, not a market trend.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Ray's worldview is very consistent across decades:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Progress is exponential, not linear. Technology improves in doubling
patterns (compute, data, biotech, etc.). Humans think linearly - we
massively underestimate what happens in the second half of an
exponential curve.</li>
<li>AI will reach human-level general intelligence soon - around 2029.
Not just narrow tools — systems that reason, learn, and adapt across
domains. After that, progress speeds up because AI designs better AI.
This is the start of the steep part of the curve.</li>
<li>The Singularity happens when non-biological intelligence becomes
vastly more powerful than all human brains combined. Intelligence growth
becomes runaway and civilization transforms at a speed we can’t
intuitively grasp. It’s an evolutionary phase shift, not just a tech
upgrade.</li>
<li>He strongly rejects the “AI replaces humans” framing. We expand our
intelligence by plugging into non-biological systems. Future humans will
merge with AI (biological + digital hybrid minds)</li>
<li>AI + biotech enables rapid advances in diagnostics, drug discovery,
and gene editing. The goal of longevity escape velocity (medical
progress adds more life than time passing) will be reached. Radical life
extension is plausible this century.</li>
<li>Work doesn't disappear - it evolves. Automation removes tasks, not
human meaning. New categories of work emerge that we can’t predict
today. As abundance rises, humans focus more on creativity,
relationships, exploration, and purpose-driven work.</li>
<li>Every major technology starts centralized, then becomes widely
accessible. Risks are real, but benefits historically outweigh harms.
The solution to tech risk is better tech + human values, not stopping
progress.</li>
<li>Consciousness can extend beyond biology. Mind is patterns and
processes. If reproduced in another substrate, consciousness can
continue or expand. Digital minds could be as rich (or richer) than
biological ones.</li>

<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brian Armstrong (Coinbase)
<ol type="1">
<li>Exchanges become universal financial marketplaces. Crypto exchanges
stop being “places to trade coins” and become places to trade everything
— using blockchain as the behind-the-scenes system. This means
everything becomes a digital token on a blockchain, which includes
stocks, bonds, funds, real estate, etc, - they are all represented the
same way: digital assets on-chain.</li>
<li>Stablecoins are the new payments layer. They are moving into
cross-border payments, business settlement, and everyday financial
flows. They are positioned as faster, cheaper, programmable
internet-native money. This is crypto’s move from speculation to real
economic utility.</li>
<li>Crypto and AI will merge. AI agent will need wallets, identity,
ability to transact. Crypto provides economic infrastructure for
autonomous AI systems. AI will be able to earn, pay, and contract on its
own.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Andrew Feldman (Cerebras)
<ol type="1">
<li>AI progress is compute-constrained. The bottleneck is no longer just
algorithms; it's chips, power, data centers. Whoevere scales compute
fastest drives AI capability.</li>
<li>Massive hardware innovation is required. The frontier isn’t just
better models — it’s better physical AI infrastructure.</li>
<li>Compute is now geopolitics. AI compute capacity is strategically
important, nationally competitive and comparable to energy or oil
infrastructure. The AI race is an infrastructure race, not just
software.</li>

<li>Jake Loosararian (Gecko Robotics)
<ol type="1">
<li>AI is leaving the screen and entering industry. AI + robotics are
being deployed in power plants, industrial facilities, and critical
infrastructure. This is aAI moving from chat &amp; code to machines
